Stalwarts of Kansas City's psychedelic and experimental music scene. Mind-bending performers. Founders of the multimedia celebration KC Psych Fest. Fronted by brothers Dedric and Delaney Moore, Monta at Odds is a ""musical immersion...into the cosmos of Krautrock, electronic, dub, psych and soul"" that is heavily influenced by the philosophical issues raised by the intersection of science fiction, creative experimentation and artistic collaboration. We are pleased to share our interview with the multifaceted Dedric Moore that touches on all these subjects and more.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong><br /><br /><br />	My brother and I are the founders of Monta at Odds. We both live and work in downtown Kansas City, Kansas. We have our HQ in the Prescott Neighborhood along with a handful of artists and musicians. It's a nice low cost area that is conducive to sparking the creative flow with a vibrant mix of ethnicity and a wide range of household income. I am a freelance producer, engineer and videographer. Delaney is a practical structure artist.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>You founded KC Psych Fest in 2012 as a way to bring KC psychedelic music to the forefront as a true multimedia experience complete with 2D and 3D art. How has Psych Fest evolved over the last four years?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The fest has moved locations but not changed our ethos of showcasing forward thinking artists who push the boundaries of whatever genre they work in. It has been an added bonus that many of our past performers have now be able to perform at venues and festivals within the region along with more mainstream genre artists. We've always pushed the multimedia experience and VJDN8 has been a big part of providing video that is presents effected live camera along with curated videos. Steve Gardels, from the Philistines, stepped in last year and did a beautiful job curating video to match each style of band that would take the stage next. We are always looking to expand how we incorporate visual art with our musical acts. I'd love to have more 3D sculptures as well as motion performance video that can project on a person as they perform live.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/exJU_0c2QMA?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3634505922/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=3231346031/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://nonstopeverything.bandcamp.com/album/get-it-right"">Get It Right by Monta At Odds</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Kansas City has a brilliant psychedelic and experimental music scene, with bands like Gemini Revolution, Mysterious Clouds, Expo '70 and your own Monta at Odds. How have you defined 'psychedelic' music for yourself as a songwriter and performer? How important is the visual element to the Monta at Odds live experience and music packaging?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Funny you should mention Gemini Revolution and Mysterious Clouds. I recorded and produced all of their releases. Expo 70 shared practice space with us and our percussionist Aaron Osborne plays bass in the Expo Seventy trio. I even co-mixed Expo Seventy's album Virtually From the Unknown.</p><br /><br /><p>For me, psychedelic music turns on that part of your brain that delights in unexpected pleasures. It could be a special effect, a repetitive mantra that builds from slight nuances, or just someone turning on every pedal that they own and letting it go full force.</p><br /><br /><p>I try and apply the approach to songwriting and mixing as working in unity where the technology expands the options but doesn't overwhelm the performance. It is easy to get stuck in valuing a special sound over what works best for the song. We are very conscious of what is best for the song versus showcasing a particular performance. Delaney and I leave our egos at the door when we enter the studio and use our performances as stepping stones to get to what's best. Sometimes my bass part will lead to new keyboard arrangements that make my part unusable and then we add a new bass or even Delaney picks it up and finishes the song. Conversely, I might add a guitar or synth that changes the direction or even a mix decision that causes us to re-evaluate the entire performance. The luxury of having our own studio is that it is a playground where we can try anything and just hit delete if it didn't work. It frees us up to make bold attempts at performances that can be built into exciting songs. That might happen where I cut up a performance of the drummer and make a song a 7 minute exploration out of a two minute idea, which indeed happened and it is a glorious indie-rock meets 60's Spy Jazz.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/RAsd5FwnZyI?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You have spoken previously about your love of science fiction (namely Philip K. Dick) and its influence on your music. What else has inspired you recently?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Arthur C. Clarke is my latest obsession. Also Issac Asimov and Ray Bradbury have crept into my studies. I took an Intro to Science Fiction class at KU a while back and the instructor, James Gunn (not the director), was friends with all of the great writers as well as an author. He was very adamant about the difference between Science Fiction and Science Fantasy explaining that events or circumstances had to have scientific possibility backed by well thought reasoning. Otherwise it is just making up stuff hence the work Fantasy. I've been drawn to the 2001: A Space Odyssey series because of how it deals with humanity's place in the cosmos. We are so obsessed with the right now as a culture that it is humbling to think how our lives are just a blip in the evolution of this planet. Within that I've been writing lyrics that deal with the cosmos as a metaphor for how we as modern humans interact with each other and the impact of those relationships. Plus I love alternative universe theory and androids and the blessings and curses that all of those components entail.</p><br /><br /><p>	<strong>What inspires you about the Kansas City music community?</strong><br /><br /><br />	What I think of as the psychedelic community is really more of the experimental community but really each of those words gets abused by the music press and the average person. The experimental community is a group of dedicated musicians that revel in performing uncompromising art and are willing to perform in unsuspecting places to provide new experiences in hearing and seeing a performance. I love that fact that things can get wild and unpredictable and conversely be quiet and intimate. I really appreciate the crowds that attend because it is silent as listeners absorb the experience fully focused. The music is a challenge at first but if you get it a few listens then you can start to hear melodies and structure that are less obvious. I see it as the same type of listen as jazz. You can start with the blues-leaning jazz or big band standards and then follow the white rabbit down the hole until you are a free-jazz expert. The same is true for ambient, dub, indie, Texas-psych, doom, prog, classic rock, electronica, psych-folk, West Coast jam band, drone, noise, and the list goes on. I always recommend starting with the classics of any said genre and then follow the trail of who inspired who and who played on what album and who produced this madness and then you'll be sitting next to Alice talking to caterpillars and drinking strange home-brewed tea.</p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1467824028","1485189802","0","0","Rock","rock|psychedelic|experimental","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/monta-odds-0","http://www.montamusic.com/","Learn more about Monta at Odds here."

As leader of My Brothers and Sisters and other music and theater-related projects, Searle's musical knowledge runs deep despite only learning to read music ten years ago. He is also a prolific, award-winning arranger and producer other other artists' work and a thoughtful chronicler of his experiences navigating the rigors of the music business. We are extremely fortunate to share the many talents of Jamie Searle with you on Listen Local.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Jamie Searle and I’m a composer based in Kansas City, Missouri. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What would you say has been the biggest difference in your approach to songwriting and technology since you've attended the UMKC Conservatory of Music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Studying music has opened my eyes to form & orchestration.  Before I began, the music I wrote tended to follow the familiar popular pattern of Verse, Chorus, Verse along with a Bridge every once in awhile, and though I’m not opposed to that formula, I switch things around a lot more, add more captivating transitions along with slick modulations and alternate chords throughout which add a lot of color and depth that makes the music more evocative overall.  Along with learning more about the symphonic pallet; strings, brass, & woodwinds, as a singular instruments and paired with others has just made writing and listening more magical than ever.  I began studying music really late in life, it was only 10 years ago that I read my first note, and I had resisted formal education of any kind because I thought it would take away that magic and inspiration I loved so dearly which ended up being the exact opposite of what I found once I put my ego in check and faced the fact that I would be entering in a world I didn’t feel necessarily a “part of” and that I was just afraid.  Technologically speaking, I’ve gained more knowledge in the last 2 years than I ever did before.  The extent of my collegiate knowledge was learning how to notate in Finale and working out of Garage Band.  Never in my life did I think that I would turn into such a techy guy, but the love of writing has always pushed me towards uncomfortable foreign places, both literally and technically.  The last couple of months have been keyboard and midi hell holes, but being able to handle various workstations & software not only is very inspiring, liberating even, but an absolute necessity in the writing and recording world to remain competitive with the big production guns out there.  Some amazing sounds are happening and it feels great to be a part of that conversation.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/AbNv6dv3758?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/233418797&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/233418061&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>On your website you write very openly and honestly about, among other things, your experiences in the music business, lessons learned and practical advice for other artists. There’s such a wealth of information and insight into the day-to-day challenges of someone who has devoted his life to music. What has the response been to these essays? Do you plan to continue this kind of writing?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The responses I’ve gotten have been positive but not in great quantity so who knows.  I’ve done it mainly because I’ve been thinking about these subjects for years and I’ve never rattled off my opinions about them in any public way.  I thought after reading many topics about some of these issues; ranging from stage fright, marketing, etc., I hadn’t heard similar thoughts echoed before so I figured I should just write them down and maybe they’ll empower somebody.  However, I don’t want to write for the purpose of “brand engagement.”  I understand why people do it, but I feel a certain self-help aspect starts to run its course after awhile and though well intentioned, becomes less thoughtful and more ego driven than the knowledge is worth.  It’s such a catch phrase world out there that it becomes so easy to adopt modes of thought and character because I feel that money and social status pushes us unknowingly into inauthentic ways of being.  I’d rather focus more at this time on stories like I did my very first piece.  Stories have a much more dramatic effect, a more subconscious affect on the reader that prose lacks.  For instance, one of my favorite stories, The Wizard of Oz, is all about these qualities we feel lacking inside of us, but are absolutely there but don’t show up until we’re ready to experience them.  We feel we need these external manifestations like a diploma or a medal to prove it.  Anyways, you’re learning things about yourself through the experience of characters, which overall, I feel is a more creative and interesting course to take rather than exploiting a personal narrative for any kind of gain.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What artists do you look to these days for inspiration? What do you admire most about these artists?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Tchaikovsky, Saint-Saens, Debussy, Ravel, Prokofiev as far as classical go.  Kendrick is obviously extremely exciting as well as D’Angelo and Flying Lotus.  There’s just a wealth of great pop and R&B production out there.  Finally and fortunately alternative bands have started paying attention which is clearly why Glass Animals has such a following.  Unfortunately it’s sad to see and important to note that the lineage between so many of these great, primarily black producers that don’t get the credit they deserve for paving the technological and stylistic roads that I see are dismissed from alternative stations like the Buzz amongst others.  You get artists like Janelle Monae, from Kansas City, a genius in my opinion, not getting the airplay she deserves because unfortunately marketing drives airplay rather than the love of music.  And of course, marketing is only interested in catering to and molding demographics.  I’ve had the unfortunate problem of being “beyond categorization” and whether it’s a blog or radio, they’re confused as how to sell you.  But whether it’s Debussy or Quincy Jones, they’ve all had the same problem which is why they’re music is so powerful.  Their music reflects their experimental journey of authenticity so not only are they engaged in this spiritual alchemy of sorts, they are pioneers of sounds that reflect that sense of self-discovery.  All artists that stand the test of time and create a very serious impact on culture study and experiment with all types of music until a synthesis begins to form so that their voice can be recognized despite the orchestral pallet or form they choose to work in.  It’s the courage to not play it safe that comes across as inspirational.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/232492695&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/232491107&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What most excites you about music in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Honestly, I’ve been watching the Kansas City music “scene” for a long time, which has largely ignored classical, r&b, gospel, jazz, & pop.  Now finally bands like Eddie Moore & the Outer Circle have been getting some love.  Hermon Mehari has been great for the city as well as Beau Bledsoe, and Anthony Magliano along with Shane Borth of  Quixotic.  It’s important to give Bobby Watson and Dan Thomas props for cultivating these great jazz musicians that have been coming out of UMKC.  It would be a grave mistake for the city to gloss over a talent like Janelle Monae again that could have been an amazing antennae for the music industry if she would have gained the recognition and support she deserved.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Jamie's recommendations from the Johnson County Library Catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Books:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/323350036_welcome_to_the_monkey_house""><em><strong>Welcome to the Monkey House</strong></em></a> <strong>by Kurt Vonnegut</strong>.

What did you learn that you'll bring to future recording projects? </strong>This was our second full-length original album and we are very proud of it. Three years as professional musicians has helped us mature tremendously as song writers, instrumentalists, singers, and artists. We feel that this album expresses our musical point of view by preserving the humor, high energy, and grittiness of traditional string band music, though from a decidedly modern perspective. We were lucky for the chance to work with local musicians Matthew Hawkins on banjo and Chris DeVictor on bass, which really helped fill out the sound. We also recorded all the tracks live on a single microphone the way bluegrass was originally recorded, and we couldn't be happier with how it turned out.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/KKIrsXl2DZA?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2993481879/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://thematchsellers.bandcamp.com/album/songs-we-made-up"">Songs We Made Up by The Matchsellers</a></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>You tour fairly often. What has been your most memorable experience on the road? </strong>We get this question all the time, and with three years of touring under our belts it's a tough one to answer. But a special experience for us recently was in New York City, where we attended a bluegrass jam led by our favorite contemporary bluegrass guitarist Michael Daves. We had no idea what to expect, or how open the New York players would be to outsiders like us. But they immediately welcomed us into the group and even nudged us up to the mic to lead a couple of songs, with some of the best players we'd ever met-- including Michael Daves himself-- surrounding us on all sides. It wasn't even a dream come true because we hadn't dared to dream that it would go so well! </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What artists do you look to these days for inspiration? What do you admire most about these artists? </strong>Bluegrass and folk music in general is steeped in tradition, so we spend a lot of time digging up old recordings to learn how the music was played 50-100 years ago. Old fiddle players like Tommy Jarrell, Cyril Stinett, and Lyman Enloe have an energy and a rhythm to their playing that makes it a perfect fit for contra and square dances. We also seek out recordings of live performances as inspiration for our stage show. The humorous banter between our songs was heavily influenced by performers like The Dillards, The Country Gentlemen, and Jimmy Martin telling jokes and stories on stage. </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What most excites you about the folk and bluegrass communities in Kansas City? </strong>The Kansas City folk community is one of the most vibrant, welcoming, and supportive that we've encountered in our travels. KKFI and The Bridge get local musicians on the radio, while the Westport Saloon and Rural Grit Happy Hour at The Brick provide a place for musicians to meet up, play together and learn from each other. Then there are great events year round that get the community involved, like the Westport Roots Festival, Porch Fest, the Crossroad Music Fest, the Winfield Warm-up and Hangover, and the Folk Alliance International Conference that will be here for two more years. And of course, there is a well of fantastic musicians, from living legends like Betse Ellis to young up-and-comers like us. We're lucky to have begun our music careers in the midst of this blossoming scene.</p><br /><br /><p>We would like to add that libraries have been a tremendous resource for us as touring musicians. In almost every city or town we go to, we know there will be a nice quiet and free place for us to spend a few hours checking emails, reading periodicals or books, and otherwise relaxing from our travels. Andrew recently read all five books of the <em>Y: The Last Man</em> graphic novel series in 3 different libraries across the Northeast. Thank you to Bryan Voell at the Johnson County Library for taking the time to put together <em>Local Live</em>, a fantastic database of musicians from the Kansas City area!</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br />      <div ><div ><br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/FnrBHnUZqUA?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/DxFp9q0xJBM?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />          </div><br /><br />  </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2993481879/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://thematchsellers.bandcamp.com/album/songs-we-made-up"">Songs We Made Up by The Matchsellers</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Julie and Andrew's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1349524036_travels_with_charley""><em>Travels with Charley</em></a> by John Steinbeck</strong>. We both read this book recently on our travels. It's a memoir about a cross-country road trip Steinbeck takes with his poodle Charley. His musings on the US are funny and insightful, and as fellow road warriors we can relate to his experiences, both good and bad.</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/322153036_slaughterhouse-five""><em>Slaughterhouse Five</em> </a>by Kurt Vonnegut.</strong> We have a special connection to this book since Vonnegut is from Andrew's home state of Indiana, and also because the story deals with the fire bombing of Dresden, a German city just an hour and a half train ride from Leipzig where we met and started playing music together. It's an amazing story that weaves together memoir, science fiction, humor and tragedy. </p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/604075036_watchmen""><em>Watchmen</em></a> by Alan Moore. </strong>Andrew has been reading graphic novels as inspiration for an upcoming album/graphic novel/performance art installation entitled <em>Bluegrasstronauts. </em>If you only read one graphic novel in your life, it should be this one (until we release <em>Bluegrasstronauts, </em>that is<em>).</em></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/402705036_jimmy_martin_the_king_of_bluegrass"">Jimmy Martin: The King of Bluegrass</a></strong>. </em>This CD is always in our car! The self-proclaimed King of Bluegrass sings gems like ""20-20 Vision"" (""I went to the doctor, he say's I'm alright, but I know that he's lyin' 'cause I'm losin' my sight!""); ""Free Born Man"" (""I ran away for the first time when I was only four years old!""); and ""Sophronie,"" named after a heart-breaking lady from Kentucky.</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1103612036_sleep_with_one_eye_open""><em>Sleep with One Eye Open </em></a>by Chris Thile and Michael Daves.</strong> In our opinion, the best and most influential contemporary bluegrass album in recent memory. These two virtuosic musicians breath new life into traditional bluegrass songs with incredible energy and grittiness that has been all but lost from most contemporary bluegrass. We recently toured up to New York City in order to meet and jam with Michael Daves!</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/416621036_is_this_it?active_tab=bib_info"">Is This It?</a></strong> </em>by The Strokes (CD)</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/133639036_12_greatest_hits""><em>12 Greatest Hits</em></a></strong> by Patsy Cline (CD)</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/252145036_golden_hits?active_tab=bib_info""><em>Golden Hits</em></a></strong> by Roger Miller (CD)</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/513693036_the_house_of_the_spirits""><em>House of the Spirits</em></a></strong> by Isabel Allende (Novel)</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/332631036_the_sun_also_rises""><em>The Sun Also Rises</em></a></strong> by Ernest Hemingway (Novel)</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/607967036_winters_bone""><em>Winter's Bone</em></a></strong> by Daniel Woodrell (Novel)</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1415721036_in_order_to_live"">In Order to Live</a></strong> </em>by Yeonmi Park (Biography)</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/341184036_run_lola_run"">Run, Lola, Run</a></strong> </em>by Tom Tykwer (DVD)</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1467219228","1485189864","0","0","Eclectic|Country|Folk - Americana","folk|bluegrass","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/matchsellers-0","https://thematchsellers.com/","Learn more about The Matchsellers here."

After moving to Kansas City three years ago, the cit has played a big role in accelerating Eades's presence as an emerging singer-songwriter and performer. We are excited to share an illuminating interview with Eades, as well as her music, movie and book recommendations and some samples of her newest songs.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I'm Erin Eades, a singer-songwriter originally from southern West Virginia, but have called Kansas City home for the last 3 years and live in the Waldo neighborhood. When I'm not making music, I work for a rental car company, traveling about 75% of the time. It certainly makes for an interesting way of life!</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/225320795&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/261825323&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Tell us about some of the challenges that come with establishing yourself as a folk artist in Kansas City.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Though a lot of my songs probably fall into the folk/singer-songwriter sound, I pull from many different genres so I would say my first challenge has been (and still is!) establishing the best description for my music! When I first moved to Kansas City, I hadn't played in public or even taken music seriously for a decade, so not only was it difficult to get motivated to play again, it was hard to know where to start in an unfamiliar city. I've been very fortunate that I've met a ton of great people along the way who continue to inspire and encourage me. The website Meetup was pivotal in getting started, introducing me to a group of musicians known as the Kansas City Music Girls, where I began my network. I can think of almost everyone I know in the KC music scene and play ""Six Degrees of Separation"" to bring it back to that amazing group of women.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>How long have you been a songwriter? Who initially influenced you? Who do you look to for inspiration these days?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I started writing music when I was about 15 and was half of an acoustic duo in high school--we even put out an EP and a full-length album of original music! I took a hiatus in college, and then life happened, and when I moved here I decided it was time to get back into it. I grew up influenced by the music my family listened to: Dad loved classic rock and blues, Mum loved country, and my brother listened to grunge, alternative, and punk rock. The Beatles are my favorite band and are the most consistent source of inspiration throughout my career. These days I'm listening to a lot of female singer-songwriters who inspire me, namely Sara Bareilles and Jill Andrews.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/erin1.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""640"" alt=""Erin Eades"" title=""Erin Eades"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/jGwRQTkpQNs?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Delve a little into your own process of songwriting. What may surprise a listener of your music about how you create your music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I tend to be a rather methodical person who craves order and processes, but when it comes to songwriting, it is very unpredictable. Someone asked me about this once before and the best description of my songwriting process that I could come up with is ""word vomit"": it just happens, I tend to write rather suddenly, and it happens very quickly once I have an idea. I keep a notebook with me all the time because I find that the best ideas happen when I'm not sitting down with my guitar and a sheet of paper. I would probably have more of a catalog if I could come up with ideas during practice, but often they strike me while driving, or when I'm trying to sleep in some unfamiliar city while I'm traveling.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>What inspires you the most about the Kansas City music scene?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I love the amount of diversity in the music that is offered. Whenever I travel and mention being part of this great music scene there are so many people that are unaware of what Kansas City has to offer: it's not just blues and jazz. I feel like there is a lot of untapped potential here, with many bands on the verge of something great. There are so many pieces in place: talented bands, supportive business owners, festivals like FAI and Middle of the Map. I think a spark is all that is needed!</p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/erin3_0.jpg"" width=""750"" height=""750"" alt=""Erin Eades"" title=""Erin Eades"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div>    <p><strong>Movies</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/371346036_best_in_show"">Best in Show</a></strong></em> -- I love this ""mockumentary"" film, where the humor is almost entirely dialogue-driven.

My copy of this book is more like a time capsule that gets opened every year. Barely held together anymore, with dog-eared pages, mementos as bookmarks from places I happened to be reading it, and a note from my brother scrawled on the inside of the front cover, telling me that the first time I read the story it would make me completely unsatisfied with life and how that wasn't a bad thing, it's truly one of my most prized possessions.</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/329325036_fight_club"">Fight Club</a></strong></em> <strong>by</strong> <strong>Chuck Palahniuk</strong>. Most people will recognize the author's name as ""that guy who wrote Fight Club"" but he has done so much more. His work is dark and takes your mind to strange places, but I enjoy his writing style. Use this as a primer for the rest of his work (<em>Survivor</em> is my favorite of his).</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Music</strong></p><br /><br /><p>(side note: I could've spent all of my recommendations in this category!!)</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1052863036_foundling"">Foundling</a></strong></em> <strong>by </strong><strong>David Gray. </strong>Nearly impossible to choose only one David Gray album, but of the selections at the library this is my favorite. I find his lyrics to be inspirational, poetic, and his voice often gives me chills.</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1395400036_ten_songs_from_live_at_carnegie_hall"">Ten Songs from Live at Carnegie Hall</a></strong></em> <strong>by </strong><strong>Ryan Adams</strong>. Much of my style is rock with a twang, so my list wouldn't be complete without one of my favorite alt-country musicians, Ryan Adams. For me, this album is Adams at his finest: solo, raw, and live.</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/954256036_backspacer"">Backspacer</a></strong></em> <strong>by </strong><strong>Pearl Jam</strong>. Not the best Pearl Jam album by any stretch, but the one with the most meaning for me. It defined a good two years of my life. Back when I started running, this was my perfect 5k-distance album (skip ""Johnny Guitar"", cooldown during ""The End""). I started kindergarten the year ""Ten"" came out and can still remember the video for ""Alive""; Pearl Jam and many bands from the early 90's grunge/rock/alternative scene have been a big part of my musical journey.</p><br /><br /></div>","0","437","1","1463590428","1492634950","0","0","Folk - Americana|Singer - Songwriter","folk|singer-songwriter|acoustic","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/erin-eades-0","http://www.erineadesmusic.com/","Learn more about Erin's music here."

Comprised of KCUR 89.3 Announcer and Arts Reporter Hannah Copeland and actor, director, filmmaker and musician Matthew Dunehoo, Tidy Hippy is what can happen when happenstance leads to artistic collaboration. The duo's recently released <em>Tidy Hippy EP </em>is short in length but filled with memorable songs and exceptional musicianship. It's a pleasure to share their music, stories and recommendations with you on Listen Local.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>What’s Tidy Hippy all about? How did the band come together?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Hannah:</strong> We, Matt and I, met accidentally. I was moving out of midtown and selling junk from around my house on Craigslist. I listed a mini fridge and Matt gave me a call. Once we met, our awkward Craigslist small talk turned into a conversation about why Matt needed the fridge; he was filming a movie and wanted to keep drinks cold for his cast. A <a href=""http://www.elkspridepictures.com/"" target=""_blank"">filmmaker</a>? I thought that interesting. I said I worked for <a href=""http://kcur.org/people/hannah-copeland#stream/0"" target=""_blank"">KCUR 89.3</a>, and we both realized we were public radio fans, and musicians, so we scheduled a jam. A year later, Tidy Hippy released our self-recorded EP and started gigging. We make films, radio, and music. We are free-spirits who love peace and rock & roll, but we do all that in our respectively organized and tidy way. That's us.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Matthew:</strong> When I met Hannah, peddling that fridge, I knew we had a creative collaborative future. I'm glad it's taken the form of Tidy Hippy. I think we pretty much settled on the band name on a very leisurely post-Chinese dinner stroll in old downtown Overland Park. We're both music respecters and practitioners. We're also both perfectionistic but sloppy enough to allow our music to breathe and be imperfectly enjoyable to play.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Talk about how the songs on Tidy Hippy EP came about. Who brought what to the table?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Hannah:</strong> Our songs usually start with a Matt playing a lick on his guitar at band practice. I will add a beat, and if the beat and melody feel right, we'll keep jamming until we have made parts to a complete song. We usually add lyrics after we write our songs. My lyrics are mostly narrative, and Matt's uses lots of wordplay with subtle themes. I wrote the lyrics to ""Death Accessory,"" an anthem calling lawmakers to allow Midwestern cities to make their own gun laws that fit the needs of their city, not their mostly rural state. Matt's SONG SONGS SONGs. We sings together, separately, and in harmony.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Matthew:</strong> Getting to practice in Hannah's parents' home has been an incredible luxury, especially after living in NYC and practicing in overpriced inhospitable 3'x3' ovens. There's always TP and her mom is an awesome cook. I always want to just crank tunes out willy-nilly without condemning them to death too soon. Hannah seems mostly on board.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=515354703/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""https://tidyhippy.bandcamp.com/album/tidy-hippy-ep"">Tidy Hippy EP by Tidy Hippy</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What was learned about the recording process for the EP that you’ll take to future projects?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Hannah:</strong> Peaking is what happens when a sound it recorded at a higher level than the input device such as a microphone can handle. It distorts the recording. We learned that certain frequencies on guitar are super loud and difficult to capture without peaking. I learned that a mic hung above my drums picks up sound much better than one sitting on the ground. We also learned that mixing, arranging the sound levels after recording, takes hours, and sometimes months. I thinks that my perfectionist standards combine with Matt's desire to produce things rapidly balances out to a pretty thorough and well-paced collective creative process.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Matthew:</strong> For a homemade recording, especially, I'm really proud of it! I think it captures the spirit of the tunes and sounds fairly ""competitive,"" professionally speaking. Neither one of us have ever had the luxury of recording in an atmosphere where money wasn't an issue and time was freely abundant. We really stuck out noses into these tunes to make them as uniformly acceptable to listen to across many platforms. I think it's easier to do that, tech-wise nowadays. But it's tough, I really admire GREAT producers.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What music are you currently raving about?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Hannah:</strong> I am in love with Alabama Shakes' soulful, silky, and dynamic sophomore album <em>Sound and Color.</em> Locally, I draw inspiration from HMPH, a Kansas City mathrock duo that plays complicated guitar and drum patterns at rapid speed using unique song structures.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Matthew:</strong> I'm always listening to ambient electronica and left-field house music as it's the best for me to write to and I try to live in as much of a drug-free blissout state as possible while still getting my homework done and if you don't count prescription SSRI's as ""drugs."" Otherwise I adore Beach House and I thought Kyle Craft's album was pretty smart, playing with him live was testament to his deal.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What excites you the most about the Kansas City-area music scene?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Hannah:</strong> I things the Kansas City music scene has great breadth, without so much depth that bands’ sounds overlap.

Taking her inspiration from books and poetry, especially that of Langston Hughes and William Shakespeare, Powell's work seeks to fuse narrative form with musical structure. Powell has written music for piano, string quartet, guitar and voice and is currently finishing her Music Composition studies at UMKC. Enjoy Powell's music and her book and music recommendations.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Hello, my name is Aubrie Powell. I live in Kansas City and am working on finishing my Masters Degree at UMKC in Music Composition. I grew up in New Mexico and did my undergraduate degree in Cleveland at a small school called Baldwin Wallace University (BW). I play the double bass and I especially enjoy playing in orchestras and in chamber groups.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>You’ve composed classical music for a variety of settings, including dance and Shakespeare productions, string quartets and electronic music. What projects are the most fulfilling for you? What’s the most challenging project you’ve been involved with?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My most fulfilling musical experience was first writing incidental music for BW’s production of Shakespeare’s play <em>All’s Well that Ends Well. </em>It was an unexpected opportunity that was a musical breakthrough for me collaboratively by making it accessible to the audience, complimentary to the story, and playable by the enthusiastic actors.</p><br /><br /><p>I enjoy collaboration because it brings together different perspectives and minds. It can be frustrating but also creates a work that is more than what one person could accomplish.</p><br /><br /><p>The most challenging project I have been involved with was writing for guitar quartet. The guitar is an interesting instrument that is complex and tricky.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/240887725&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/226454790&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Who inspires your art the most?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I am probably most inspired by books and poetry. The details can trigger musical ideas. For example, the poetry of Langston Hughes is extremely musical and thoughtful and I wrote a song cycle based on four of his poems. Musical form is inherently narrative to me, so in reading a book I can imagine how it would translate to musical structure.</p><br /><br /><p>I am very interested in integrating the human voice into chamber music and most of my influence in this vein has come from Amy Beth Kirsten’s work. She is a composer and teacher on the east coast who does a lot of experimentation in extended techniques and vocalization.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What tools do you use to compose? What may surprise a listener about how your music is written?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I use all the tools available to me to compose, including my bass, the piano, and just playing around on my computer. It may not be surprising but I often write in chunks and think about the order and connecting material later. The grouping together of different chunks and shaping them together is my favorite part of composition. The tedious part is actually generating the material, but once it is there the manipulation and shaping is really fun.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What inspires you the most about the Kansas City music scene?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Kansas City has a really great vibe. I have never lived in a place that has such a strong sense of community. I really enjoyed the Green Lady and the jazz scene. Kansas City offers so much variety in music with the all the events at the Kauffman and the performance venues downtown. The art museums are spectacular and so close to UMKC. I also really like the zoo here, especially the kangaroo exhibit.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/219923442&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/219920786&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Aubrie's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I enjoy all the trilogies by<strong> <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?t=author&q=hobb%2C+robin&commit=Search&searchOpt=catalogue"">Robin Hobb</a></strong>. She has a way of taking the narrative to such a high-tension point that it seems unbearable, and then she finds some kind of resolution. Her endings truly show a progression from the beginning to end and you end up someplace new, not a happily ever after. Also all the trilogies overlap with the others. In one series you are following a ship trader family and they cope with the impact of the royal family’s bastard from another trilogy. Hobb’s writing also shows a great understanding of perspective and humanity. Every character changes or parts of them are revealed more slowly. I find it a well-formed and intricate piece of fantasy.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>I really like the <strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Rowling%2C+J.+K.%22&search_category=author&t=author"">Harry Potter series</a></strong>. It has had little influence on me musically, but J.K. Rowling’s imagination is incredible. Every time I read the books there is some detail I find that hits me in a new way. It is like what they say about listening to a Mahler symphony, that every listening you hear something new.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>The <strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&t=smart&search_category=keyword&q=dresden+files&searchOpt=catalogue"">Dresden Files series</a></strong> by Jim Butcher really appeals to my sense of humor in literature and in music.

Wright had a direct impact on my music because I decided as a freshman in college to write a symphonic work based on the characters.

In addition to writing catchy, rocking and thought-provoking tunes, Witt is an accomplished painter whose <a href=""http://www.sterlingwitt.com/slideshows.htm"">visual work</a> is as vibrant as his music. Released late last year, Witt's latest album, <em>Satyagraha,</em>which Witt calls his ""greatest musical achievement"", will definitely appeal to Nirvana fans (and not only because it was produced by Steve Albini). We are very fortunate to share an interview with and book, music and movie recommendations from Sterling Witt.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I am an artist. I live in Missouri. I split my time between the East Crossroads of Kansas City and the Art Farm near Freeman, Missouri (about 45 min south of KC). The Art Farm is an isolated oasis in the country designed for making art and music. We do not have Internet or TV.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Describe the musical journey from 2004’s <em>Self Portrait</em> to the recent <em>Satyagraha</em> project. How has your approach to songwriting evolved over the years?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em>Self Portrait</em> is an introspective album. I recorded those songs in my apartment in Los Angeles, CA. I played all the instruments with the exception of the drums. The album is fueled by dark emotions. A personal confessional bloodletting of how I felt at the time. <em>Self Portrait</em> is a snapshot in time. It has been 12 years. <em>Self </em><em>Portrait</em>and <em>Satyagraha</em> couldn't be more different from each other. That being said, all the songs were all written alone with pen, paper and guitar. Steve Albini at Electrical Audio Studios in Chicago, Illinois, recorded my current album, <em>Satyagraha</em>, with my 3-piece band (Jesse Gilpin on drums, Davy Langerak on the bass, and myself on guitar and vocals). Getting this band together is one of my greatest musical achievements. The band gives <em>Satyagraha</em> this unleashing maniacal live sound. It sounds live because it <em>is</em>. The three of us showcase each other’s strong points. We have a great respect for each other and we know our collective mission is to make the songs the best they can be. We recorded and mixed <em>Satyagraha</em> in four days. During that time we lived at Electrical Audio. <em>Satyagraha</em> is a politically charged album, with a message of seeking the truth, spiritual revolution and love. In 2004 the idea of having a band and recording with Steve Albini was nothing more than a dream. So in a way I am living out my fantasies of 2004.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/g4JlVvH2VZU?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You’re also an accomplished visual artist. Talk about how you see the connection between your visual art and the music you create.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The initial action I take when I'm making visual art and music is the same. I'm looking for a spontaneous outburst that can't be forced. Something that has to be captured organically. The reason behind making music or visual art is the same for me and somewhat unexplainable as to why I do one or the other. It would be like asking someone why did they get a drink of water. They must have been thirsty. That’s why I make art and music, I'm thirsty. They are equal to me. One without the other would be a work-in-progress and incomplete in some way. There is this overwhelming urge. It's always been there for as long as I can remember.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Talk a little about the themes you address in your lyrics, especially on the new album.</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em>Satyagraha</em> is steeped in politics, religion, war, and love. The word Satyagraha means: insistence on truth or truth force. Gandhi came up with the term during his non-violent resistance movement in the early 1900's. The truth is my ultimate interest, which has inspired the lyrics on Satyagraha. The truth: what is it? Are we willing to accept it? What if it disproves our beliefs? Will we deny it? The truth is the truth no matter what we think, feel or believe. It is what it is. That should be obvious. The lyrics on <em>Satyagraha</em> are often directed right at the listener. For example ""Our beliefs are a poor excuse for and education"" - ""Who do you listen to and why?"" - ""If your goal was to mind control the entire population, war would be the only way"" - ""Do we question authority, question all tyranny, question the governmental system under which we labor?"" - ""Love is the answer you're not looking for."" - There are occasional moments of light heartedness like: - ""As I fall a sleep I pretend you’re in my arms, my dreams about you baby are wicked alarms"". My goal is to have a message. To say something I can sing over and over again and feel good about it. This is why my lyrical focus has changed so much over the years. Songs are mantras that you repeat over and over again. The subject matter has the power to affect the performer and the listener.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What excites you the most about the Kansas City-area music scene?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The music scene in Kansas City is growing and changing for the better. There are more bands, musicians, music venues and record stores than there were just a few years ago. Everyone involved is proud to be a part of the Kansas City music scene. That's exciting to me.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/KFxF8BNJMQ8?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Sterling's recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Books:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><em>Earth</em></strong> by Barbara Marciniak</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1451463036_the_book_of_the_damned""><em>The Book of the Damned</em></a></strong> by Charles Fort</p><br /><br /><p><strong><em>Human Race Get off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More</em></strong> by David Icke</p><br /><br /><p><strong><em>Matrix of Power: Secrets of World Control</em> </strong>by Jordan Maxwell</p><br /><br /><p><strong><em>Science Liberty and Peace</em></strong> by Aldous Huxley</p><br /><br /><p><strong><em>Who Built the Moon</em></strong> by Christopher Knight and Alan Butler</p><br /><br /><p><strong><em>Defending Sacred Ground</em></strong> by Alex Collier</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Movies:</strong></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><em><strong>A Trip to the Moon</strong></em> (Directed by Georges Méliès)</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/823535036_the_films_of_alejandro_jodorowsky"">Holy Mountain</a></strong></em> (Directed by Alexandro Jodorowsky)</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/325322036_dune"">Dune</a></strong></em> (Directed by David Lynch)</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/851192036_12_monkeys"">12 Monkeys</a></strong></em> (Directed by Terry Gilliam)</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/950357036_fire_in_the_sky"">Fire in the Sky</a></strong></em> (Directed by Robert Lieberman)</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/346311036_the_princess_bride"">The Princess Bride</a></strong></em> (Directed by Rob Reiner)</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1193387036_resurrect_dead"">Resurrect Dead: The Mystery of the Toynbee Tiles</a></strong></em> (Directed by Jon Foy)</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Music:</strong></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/924164036_trout_mask_replica"">Trout Mask Replica</a></strong></em> by Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/519657036_real_gone"">Real Gone</a></strong></em> by Tom Waits</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong>Incesticide</strong></em> by Nirvana</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong>To Bring You My Love</strong></em> by PJ Harvey</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong>Near Truths & Hotel Rooms, Live</strong></em> by Todd Snider</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/668203036_the_violin_sonatas"">Sonata for Violin & Piano No. 18 in G major, K. 301</a></strong></em> by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/541949036_quelquun_ma_dit"">Quelqu'Un</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/541949036_quelquun_ma_dit""> M'A Dit</a></strong></em> by Carla Bruni</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/OPVT84D44GM?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>","0","437","1","1469638428","1485795437","0","0","Alternative|Pop|Rock","rock|pop","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/sterling-witt-0","http://www.sterlingwitt.com/","Learn more about Sterling Witt's music, art and other projects here."

Originally from Springfield, Missouri, Erica may be new to the Kansas City music scene but her voice and songwriting reveal real depth and dedication to her craft. We are extremely lucky to feature an interview with Erica as she prepares to release her first EP in addition to performing regularly in and around Kansas City, recording new music, covers and videos, which we have samples of below. Erica was also kind enough to share her current inspirations and recommendations from the <a href=""http://www.jocolibrary.org/"">Johnson County Library catalog</a>. Enjoy!</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Erica Joy Freiert, I go by Erica Joy. I grew up in Springfield, MO and went to the University of Missouri Kansas City on a cross country scholarship where I got my degree in Business. Currently, I work at Mass Medical Storage during the day and by night, I work on my music.</p><br /><br /><p>During the day I work at Mass Medical Storage. I get off at 6pm then usually can be seen out and about in midtown, hanging out with friends, playing a show, seeing a show, or crashing some open mics.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about the EP you’re working on. What are you learning about your own craft or the recording process that has surprised you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I have a bunch of song ideas saved in my phone, little verses, melodies and what not. My good buddy Khitam, who plays guitar with me and is my manager, has been instrumental in really getting me to sit down and hash songs out. We will sit down with a laptop and guitar and literally feed each other lines back and forth and most of the time within 20 minutes we have a full song.</p><br /><br /><p>The recording process is a lot longer and more involved than I thought it would be. It’s hard to tap back into that headspace that I was in when I first thought up a song. I’ve been working on turning those emotions into a character that I can now quickly access when I need to get in the right mood.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Can you point to one time in your life where you knew you wanted to be a songwriter? Who or what inspired you early on to create music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Around 13 years old, I met my birth mom, ps I’m adopted haha. She introduced me to a bunch of singer songwriters that we listened to on long road trips that we took. That and there were a couple of instances where my peers were very complimentary of my voice and that really gave me the courage to pursue this.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=1590469911/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""https://ericajoymusic.bandcamp.com/track/fun-to-hold-you"">Fun To Hold You by Erica Joy</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Who or what currently inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Patty Griffin is everything. I’m never not in the mood to not listen to her. Brandi Carlile is also a huge influence on me. As a child, I really loved the Dixie Chicks. Oh and I can’t forget Ray Lamontagne.</p><br /><br /><p>Other than people, I am influenced by unfortunate situations whether they’re my own, a friends, or something I hear about. That being said, happiness can also inspire me, I’m not completely depressing haha.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Where and how do you record your music? What advice do you have for others who want to do the same?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I have a little two input interface and mic that I use to record with. It’s amazing how good you can get your music to sound with a home made studio and you don’t have to shell out an arm and a leg.</p><br /><br /><p>To record my first single “Fun to Hold You” we enlisted some help from some extremely talented local musicians and producers. Kyle Ward recorded the single and his band mate Jonny Brack played drums on it. They have some higher end equipment that they have set up in a studio in a church basement. Wonderful experience and I can’t wait to work with them again hopefully on my EP by the end of the summer.</p><br /><br /><p>I’m still pretty new with the whole music thing. I really hit the ground running in April. I would say, find the time to invest in your craft. I thrive on having a routine where I hold myself accountable whether it’s writing a new song a week or putting up a cover.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/66380734&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Erica's recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>1. <strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Griffin%2C+Patty%22&search_category=author&t=author"">Patty Griffin:</a></strong> She is my heart and soul.

Before even releasing what will be his first album he has established himself as a major musical presence in Kansas City, with impassioned performances both solo and with the popular My Brothers and Sisters ensemble. In this interview, Singleton delves into the joys and challenges of recording his new album, his diverse influences and how libraries helped shape the artist he is today. Enjoy!</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I live in the Heart of Westport in the Valentine neighborhood! My day job as an event coordinator manager and sales support specialist happens in Lenexa, KS.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about the Go Fund Me project for your debut album<em>Caged</em><em> Bird Sings Songs About Red Beard.</em> Where are you in the recording process? Who are you working with on it?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Go Fund Me has been really positive and also interesting. We started with a Kickstarter and barely missed our goal. It was a really tough thing to get so close and then not reach the place we hoped for but to receive the outpouring of love and generosity from friends, family and people I would've never expected it from was unlike anything I've experienced before. I really felt like what I was trying to do with my voice and with music MATTERED to others and that I had support for a vision of myself I've had since I was 6 years old. Many of those supporters went right over to Go Fund Me and pledged again and that was a great feeling. I like that it is ongoing and that there is no time limit. As an artist we are always in need of financial support for recording, distribution, touring, promotion and more. I'm lucky to have a day job but I am still not a major label artist with those resources and budgets.</p><br /><br /><p>There is a myth that we as independent artists should just be able to do this ourselves and then like magic we should be a successful as Adele. That isn't how this industry works and even major acts are using crowd funding because the labels simply do not have money anymore. I got flak for crowd funding and it really made me wish someone could spend a day in my shoes and see the business side of my LLC. To see how much I make from a song they stream, buy or illegally download or how much it costs to book your band versus what you get back after a gig. It is all me all the time. There is a freedom and independence in that and I have learned so much but it is hard and any help is so appreciated by us. I have big dreams and I am taking steps to achieve them but support is huge and necessary whether you are hoping to reach the world like me or just your region or community.</p><br /><br /><p>Jamie Searle and I have been working tirelessly on this album and we should be done in the fall! I am beyond excited to present this body of work and haven't worked harder on anything else in my life! Jamie and I believe in slow-cooking music so we take our time and make sure it is everything we can dream it to be. I have lived with these songs for the past 6 years and wrote most of them before meeting Jamie about 3 years ago. To have him as a producer and arranger but also as my best friend has been incredible. Somehow he was able to hear my melodies and lyrics and know exactly what the songs sounded like in my head. Our partnership elevates them so much more though. It's an album about love that is super personal but so universal and the sounds we have discovered and created are very worldly, inviting, lush and unique. There isn't another project out that sounds like this and that pays tribute to music like this. <em>Caged Bird Sings Songs About Red Beard</em> is a classic pop album and we can't wait to add it to the treasured list of classics we have throughout history. Besides Jamie we have brought in KC Symphony string players, revered local musicians, and amazing engineers and mixers like Joel Nanos! I'm actually hoping for some cool collaborations before we wrap that I am keeping a crazy tight lid on. I am very excited. It has taken my whole life to make this album. This is my debut to the world and I couldn't me more proud of it!</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/221371659&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How have libraries influenced your work as a songwriter?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Growing up in inner-city Wyandotte County the library was my quiet safe haven! There was no poverty, gunshots or race separating me from knowledge and that was powerful for me. I got to escape in books, albums and videos that expanded my mind and opened my writing up to a place where poetry started to turn into songwriting at age 11. I would get dropped off for an hour and just get lost in there. If I wasn't reading I was writing and I was in peace, privacy and solitude that I didn't have at home with a younger brother, paper thin walls and all of the distractions around me. Songwriting is such a private, internal thing for me and then performance is like a public exorcism or therapy session! I got to be my introverted curious, observant and inquisitive self at the public library and it made me feel okay with that. It helped me find me and be okay with whom I was growing into, enough to be a singer-songwriter and recording artist today that isn't afraid to share what I've learned from the library of life.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What music are you currently raving about?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I am really kind of a crate digger and gravitate toward classics more than new music but I stay aware of new music for sure. Billie Holiday, Prince and old Grunge/Alternative music are go-tos for me usually but I did really like the new Oh Wonder, Twenty88, Tweet and Rihanna albums. If a whole album doesn't catch me then songs that stick out or singles do for sure. I like exploring through Shazam at house parties and digging through blogs to get out of the Top 40 trap (although I have some definite pop guilty pleasures!). I think the last few albums I listened to all the way through that really captured me were Anti (Rihanna), To Pimp A Butterfly (Kendrick Lamar), 25 (Adele), Lemonade (Beyoncé) and the self-titled Twenty88 album. It is hilarious because none of my music sounds like that! When I am writing I am either in complete silence or listening to Led Zeppelin, classic jazz and R&B or Hole, lol. I don't want anything on radio really influencing my creativity. My taste varies and inspiration is inevitable but my real inspiration for my work comes together from a lot of past time periods and melts together in a crazy way. Controversy aside, I loved the new Azealia Banks mixtape, Slay-Z. Other than that I am definitely intrigued by Kaytranada, Anderson .Paak, Judith Hill, Lucius and Tori Kelly.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/245809535&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/193686688&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1470848028","1485189567","0","0","Singer - Songwriter|Rock|R and B - Soul|Pop","rhythm and blues|rock|pop","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/stephonne-singleton-0","http://www.stephonne.com/","Learn more about Stephonne Singleton here."

Currently a doctoral student in Musicology at UMKC, Henry's range as a composer covers everything from straight-up classical to kaleidoscopic solo piano to indescribable musique ;concrète. It's a pleasure to share an interview with the artist about his pop-punk roots in high school, his flexible approach to composition and what makes Kansas City a great place for music.</p><br /><br /><p>*  </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I live in Kansas City, Missouri, and right now I’m still student. I’m getting a doctorate in composition as well as a master’s degree in Musicology (music history, basically) at UMKC. I’ve been drifting further and further west as time goes by: I was born in New Hampshire, moved to Virginia, did my undergrad in Pittsburgh at Carnegie Mellon, got my master’s at the University of Michigan, and now I’ve been here for the past two years. I just started working in the LaBudde Special Collections archive here on campus as well which I’m very excited about. Believe it or not, some people actually really like doing research and archive work, and I’m one of them! Seriously, folks, libraries are great (and no one is even paying me to say that!).</p><br /><br /><p>	<strong>The music on your SoundCloud page is all over the map: straight-up classical, experimental, string quartets, and much more. There’s a rich well of creativity here. How would you describe your approach to composition?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I honestly don’t think I have a single set approach to composition, which might be part of why my music runs such a wide gamut. I may be getting a doctorate in composition, but I got into music by playing guitar and drums in pop-punk bands in high school. I barely even knew who Beethoven was when I decided to pursue composition in undergrad, and thankfully I was naïve enough for that not to deter me.  I still love pop-punk, and these underlying musical ideas of accessibility and frenetic energy continue to permeate my music, but I’ve also absorbed influences of other genres, of singer-songwriters, of classical composers, etc., and so I try not to fall into any single rut. I love so many different genres and artists and I try to keep all of these influences in mind when I write my own music. And honestly sometimes I just hear a track and think: “Wait. Could I write something in this style?” And that’s how I wound up writing a Muzak-sounding track for a film a friend of mine made.</p><br /><br /><p>It probably sounds cliché, but I do treat every piece differently, and I’ve tried to absorb a large number of styles and let the musical material of any specific piece dictate how the piece should continue.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/269096033&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What do you feel you’re best at?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I think I’m best at not taking myself too seriously. I know a lot of people writing some great music, but I also know a number of people who have this composer-as-genius/worship-my-brilliance persona, and they wonder why people are alienated by their work and their attitude. Music can certainly be powerful, but I think it’s most powerful when you’re being real and not giving yourself some illusory grandeur. And in my case, I like to think my music is honest but not pretentious, and I feel like even my more ‘academic’ stuff is accessible without being vapidly populist. It’s not apparent in all my works, but I also like to throw in a decent amount of humor in my music, as humor has always played a huge role in my life (see: basically all of my library catalog recommendations). A good blend of humor and drama adds poignancy to both the humor <em>and </em>the drama, and for my personal taste, this makes a much more effective work of art than something that is all serious all the time.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>What makes Kansas City a hub for so many powerful classical and avant-garde composers?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Well this city has so much to offer, and at a fraction of the cost (and oversaturation) as cities like New York and Los Angeles. The Kauffman Center is the most beautiful concert hall I’ve ever been in, and here in Kansas City, I’m just as comfortable there as I am at the Saloon in Westport, drinking a Manhattan and listening to live bluegrass. So not only is there something for everyone here, but there’s no elitism; you can both go to the symphony hall and enjoy music at a dive bar, and nobody’s going to think less of you on any part of that spectrum. Everything is fair game here, and it’s all readily accessible. When I first got into town two years ago, I went to see a Kansas City Electronic Music and Arts concert that took place at the Grünauer restaurant downtown, and it was such a unique and unexpected combination of experimental electronic music and Austrian cuisine; I knew right then that I’d feel at home here.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/143963791&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/24926468&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What tools do you use for composing?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>For classical composition, Sibelius is my best friend; it’s music engraving software. Basically, the least glamorous part about composition is making your music legible for people to perform. Sibelius lets me put notes on the page and play it all back on the computer with crudely synthesized instruments and sort of get a feel for what the finished product will sound like, and it also gives me the capability to gussy up the printed music so performers can read it and do it justice.</p><br /><br /><p>For electronic compositions, the computer playback basically IS the final product, so for that I use Ableton Live. Since I don’t need performers for purely electronic works, I don’t need to make a physical score or make it look pretty. I have a small MIDI keyboard to input notes, and then I apply different effects and edits to the sounds and go from there. And if I use both electronics and live instruments, I use both Sibelius and Ableton and try to make my Sibelius score accurately represent the piece’s electronic elements.</p><br /><br /><p>Oh, and of course I use good old pencil, paper, and electric piano to germinate most of my ideas.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/189654620&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What may surprise a listener about how your music is created?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Probably how little I actually use a piano or any sort of instrument once I decide on the building blocks of the piece I’m writing. I’ll come up with a melody, a collection of pitches, some harmonic and rhythmic ideas, a concept around which to structure the piece, instrumentation, etc., usually with my piano or sometimes my guitar, but once I have the main elements in place, it’s just a matter of playing with those. By this point, I know enough about how different combinations of intervals sound that once the building blocks are there, I don’t really need the piano anymore, I start to let my instincts guide how the piece will move, as I recycle the piece’s structural elements in different ways.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>What inspires you the most about the Kansas City classical music community?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I’m most inspired by how we support one another. I’ve been in and heard tales from others about environments that were hostile and toxic… If you receive an award or get recognition, people might offer lukewarm congratulations to your face, but behind your back they’ll be bitter and resentful about it. It’s a dog-eat-dog world so I can understand that to an extent; it’s like someone else receiving recognition means you DIDN’T get that recognition.</p><br /><br /><p>Conversely, the attitude I’ve experienced here is one of genuine and honest support, and that is much more positive and makes me more inclined to put my heart into what I do. If you don’t get an award or recognition but your friend does, you genuinely congratulate them with no envy, and you feel happy knowing they would do the same thing for you: there’s just a nice sense of community here. Classical music for the moment seems like a dying art form, and if we’re all going down on this sinking ship together, we might as well cheer each other on as it sinks. That might sound like a bummer note to end on, but I laugh at and relish the absurdity (and perhaps futility) of it all. If people listen to and connect with my music on some level, that’s amazing. If they don’t, it at least feels nice just to create something, and I’m happy with that.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/135688728&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Dillon's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/355934036_this_is_spinal_tap"">This Is Spinal Tap</a></strong></em> (DVD)</p><br /><br /><p>This is an absolute must-see for anyone who is a fan of music and comedy (which I hope is everyone?), and if you've already seen it, it demands you re-watch it. It is a landmark of the mockumentary genre, and the fact that the majority of the film's dialogue was improvised pushes its brilliance to stupefying levels. I grew up on this film, can quote it pretty much in its entirety, and I could probably count on one hand the number of conversations I've had with my parents in the past decade that DIDN’T involve any Spinal Tap quotes.</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/113034036_the_stranger"">L'Etranger (The Stranger)</a></strong></em> by Albert Camus</p><br /><br /><p>This isn't the most uplifting book, but I love it and find it to be bleakly hilarious. Something about absurdism resonates with me, this notion that no matter how hard we struggle to find meaning in our lives, there just isn't any to be found. It's both liberating and insanely depressing, and I can't help but laugh at that! Seriously though, Camus manages to create the single most apathetic character in literary history and makes you connect with him, and there's something powerful and thought-provoking about that.</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/791498036_the_darjeeling_limited"">Darjeeling Limited</a></strong></em> (DVD)</p><br /><br /><p>I love all of Wes Anderson's movies for the uncanny-bordering-surreal worlds they create, and this film is almost criminally underrated. The writing is witty and the character interactions are humorous but heart-wrenching. Anderson is a master at blending humor and drama, and the cinematography here provides an added layer of brilliance and depth to this oft-overlooked film. The color palettes are mesmerizingly ubiquitous, and Anderson's hallmark use of symmetry is paradoxically both off-putting and welcome here. There are subtleties and symbolism in the film that reveal themselves further with repeated viewings, giving it a great replay value.

Here, Tom Stoppard uses his acerbic British wit to spin a gut-busting existentialist yarn with two fringe characters from Hamlet at its focus as they ponder their own existence, which seems only to be necessary as it pertains to the life of Hamlet. It also features one of my favorite literary exchanges: ""We might as well be dead. Do you think death could possibly be a boat?"" ""No, no, no ... Death is ... not. Death isn't. You take my meaning. Death is the ultimate negative. Not-being. You can't not-be on a boat."" ""I've frequently not been on boats."" ""No, no, no - what you've been is not on boats.""</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/421462036_symphony_no_1_hymns_symphony_no_4"">Symphony No. 1; Hymns; Symphony No. 4</a></strong></em> by Charles Ives (CD)</p><br /><br /><p>Really anything by Charles Ives is worth listening to, but his fourth symphony in particular is a masterpiece. Ives was one of the first composers to craft a uniquely American sound in an art form mired in Western European tradition and taste. Ives's fourth symphony, like much of his output in general, is at times serene yet wistful, and at other times face-meltingly chaotic, with very little in between. He piles layer upon dissonant layer of material to build tension and excitement, but his frequent quotation of Protestant hymns, popular tunes of the day, and American patriotic songs keep it within the realm of accessibility, and imbue his works with a particularly American brand of both fervor and nostalgia. Ives’s proclivity toward layering disparate thematic material has heavily influenced my own works. There are so many sounds and styles of music bombarding us constantly, it’s almost baffling that so many artists choose to stick within the confines of one single genre in any given work.</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1078248036_pinkerton"">Pinkerton</a></strong></em> by Weezer (CD)</p><br /><br /><p>Although I was late to the party in getting this album, when I finally listened to it in my late teens, I was blown away. Rivers Cuomo's songwriting here is raw and almost uncomfortably emotional and confessional. The gritty, purposefully unpolished accompaniment and production on Pinkerton only enhance the album's feelings of desperation and self-deprecation, and it is gripping. Pinkerton is the perfect example to show that technical showmanship and sleek, polished production aren't always preferable to a product that is so full of torment that it NEEDS to be sloppy, sludgy, and visceral, which is a lesson I heed constantly in my own compositions.</p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1471284341","1485189397","0","0","Classical|Experimental","classical|electronic|electroacoustic","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/dillon-henry-0","https://soundcloud.com/dillonhenry","Hear more of Dillon's music here."

With a professional background that includes acting and production work on Portlandia (Season 2) and American Idol (Season 9), May is also a powerful singer and songwriter with a dedicated following of fans in Kansas City. With this edition of Listen Local, May sheds some light on the many different styles of music she writes and performs, how she breaks through creative blocks and her advice for young songwriters.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about yourself. How long have you been a musician and songwriter?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I have been writing songs since I was 15, I started playing shows at coffee houses and DIY all ages venues when I was 15, mostly basements of friends little self run venues. One of my favorite venues I started out at was my friend Ryan Campbell's basement. When Ryan would have shows (Prairie Village) Over 300 kids would come sometimes, it was crazy, lots of friendships started there with musicians I still see active in the Kansas City scene. About myself...I started out in professional theatre, I took acting really seriously as a child, studied it, auditioned all the time, got some professional work at a very young age. Once I hit about the age of 14/15 I started getting let down and frustrated when I would go to auditions and not book the roles, so I decided to write my own work, I started writing songs. As an adult I have gotten back into acting, I really regret not pursuing it more as a young woman, but I think it is hard to be 15 and deal with all that rejection.  In the acting world it is 99 percent let downs and rejection. In the next phase of my life I hope to be acting more because it is also a deep passion of mine, they go hand in hand for me.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/118708428&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br /><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/170884588&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br /><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/177535051&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Your Soundcloud page features an eclectic array of styles: ambient soundtrack music, girl-hop, American folk, French electronic pop, among many others. Is this genre-hopping a way to challenge yourself as an artist or would you consider it harder to stick with one style?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Honestly when it comes down to it I just love pop music. Pop music always has been and always will be my number one addiction, I actually listen to top 40 religiously because I wanna learn how to write songs that could be hits. Writing for other more well known artists is something I have just began adventuring into. Pop music is quick, smart, on point, and a direct reflection of the times. I love pop music from most decades. At the end of the day though I know my strengths and it is folk music. I write simple sad folk songs written for acoustic guitar, those songs are my strongest and I love the simplicity of one single acoustic guitar and my voice. I know when I am an old lady still playing shows and writing music it will be folk music, so I guess you could say I am at my core a folk artist, but one with desires to break into pop music.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/fmWHK3ni8ns?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your songwriting process. How do you break through creative blocks?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>As I have gotten older ( I have been playing shows and writing songs for 15 years) I have discovered that my process has to come form bursts of inspiration, I cannot force it ever. Going to see films in the theatre gives me huge inspiration, the experience of seeing the film in the theatre then leaving the theatre and walking around town thinking about the film I just experienced and how it makes me want to write something, or not write something. I usually throw some wine and cigarettes in there and feel inspired to write. My favorite director right now is Terrance Malick, his films make me wanna expose myself more through lyrics and melody. When I get blocks I get depressed, but every artist goes through this, it is a part of living.</p><br /><br /><p>Who or what inspires you?</p><br /><br /><p>Who: Dolly Parton, Jeff Bridges, Taylor Swift, Meryl Streep, Jane Goodall, Stevie Knicks, Kate Bush, Bjork, Lykke Li, Loretta Lynn, Elliott Smith, Kurt Cobain. Bill Murray, Elle Fanning, Bob Dylan (obviously lol) Billie Holiday, Michael Jackson.</p><br /><br /><p>What: Evolving, Living without fear of the consequences, Failing at something you love and choosing to keep going.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/bvclU7h9lfA?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Where and how do you record your music? What advice do you have for others who want to do the same?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I did my last album with Tim J. Harte (Mother Russia Industries) A small DIY label based out of Kansas City. My album with Tim was recorded live and completely stripped down, inspired by Elliott Smith's first old demo's. I also record with David Bennet (of Akkilles) he has a great home studio and pretty nice equipment. I am learning to record on my own, but enjoy working with sound engineers more than working on my own. My advice to other recording artists is to find someone you like working with and keep them close in your life, it is really difficult to have only one set of ears on a project, more progress is made with more ears.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/HnOA9fSlPGM?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Margo's Recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://https//jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1205091036_dream_more"">Dream More</a> By Dolly Parton</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1353689036_the_wild_truth"">The Wild Truth</a> by Carine Mccandleuss (a follow up to ""Into the Wild""</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1272265036_david_and_goliath"">David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants</a> by Malcom Gladwell</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1277879036_actors_anonymous"">Actors Anonymous</a> By James Franco</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Films:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1340995036_palo_alto""><em>Palo Alto</em></a></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1138615036_the_tree_of_life""><em>The Tree of Life</em></a> -- Directed by Terrance Malick</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1263979036_the_east""><em>The East</em></a></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/347661036_jaws""><em>Jaws</em></a> -- Directed by Steven Spielberg</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/8UXSK5ScMTU?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Photo credit: <a href=""http://hannahlavenburg.tumblr.com/"">Hannah Lavenburg</a></strong></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1432836341","1484777403","0","0","Singer - Songwriter","singer-songwriter|guitar","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/margo-may","http://www.margomay.com/","Learn more about Margo's music here."

Any chance we have at some real time to get creative we take it. Sometimes one person will bring a song that they have begun and we will finish it as a group. Sometimes we will make something up together from scratch. Once in a while a member brings a finished song and simply tells the rest of us what to do. We are all good with any process, honestly, just getting together once a week is such a refreshing break for us, we will just make it work however we can.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/2EJhrj0KXW4?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How does collaboration and live performance figure into the music you write?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>As far as live performance we try to coordinate our clothing and dress the stage up to be aesthetically pleasing. We want the stage to look as warm and cozy as possible. We also craft our setlist to flow well and keep people moving and excited, we welcome any audience participation we can get and try to encourage that. The music writing, however, is usually separate and we want it to stand on its own.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/pic1.jpg"" width=""900"" height=""600"" alt=""The Cave Girls"" title=""The Cave Girls"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div>    <p><strong>What artists do you look to these days for inspiration?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Old and local and sometimes both.

We love the First Friday monthly celebration of fine art, folk art, fashion and music in the Crossroads district. We also had the opportunity, this year, to play at the Nelson-Atkins Museum for their Third Thursday Folk Art feature back in May 2015. That was a surreal experience because playing our energetic, somewhat obnoxious, music in an internationally renowned art museum was the last thing we thought we’d be doing. Kansas City is a great place to be a musician!</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>The Cave Girls' recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Books:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?t=smart&q=complete+guitar+course+fleming&commit=Search&searchOpt=catalogue"">The Complete Guitar Course: Learn to Play in 20 Easy-to-Follow Lessons</a></strong></em> by Tom Fleming</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/841475036_the_war_of_art"">The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles</a></strong></em> by Steven Pressfield</p><br /><br /><p>​<em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/181283036_the_holy_bible"">The Holy Bible</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/783786036_how_sassy_changed_my_life"">How Sassy Changed My Life: A Love Letter to the Greatest Teen Magazine of All Time</a></strong></em> by Kara Jesella</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1362950036_the_rockstar_remedy"">The Rockstar Remedy: A Rock & Roll Doctor's Prescription for Living A Long, Healthy Life</a></strong></em> by Gabrielle Francis</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/934937036_the_girls_guide_to_rocking"">The Girl's Guide to Rocking: How to Start A Band, Book Gigs, and Get Rolling to Rock Stardom</a></strong></em> by Jessica Hopper</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Music:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1373387036_the_anthology,_1964-1971"">The Anthology, 1964 - 1971</a></strong></em> by The Kinks</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1014963036_greatest_hits#bib_info"">Greatest Hits</a></strong></em> by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts</p><br /><br /><p>​</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Movies:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1384010036_god_help_the_girl"">God Help the Girl</a></strong></em> (DVD)</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1308664036_the_punk_singer"">​The Punk Singer: A Film About Kathleen Hanna</a> </strong></em>(DVD)</p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1454353541","1485193273","0","0","Rock","garage rock|punk","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/cave-girls","https://www.reverbnation.com/thecavegirls","Learn more about The Cave Girls here."

His second album and his first with his backing band The Rabbits, <em><a href=""https://scotthrabko.bandcamp.com/"">Biscuits and Gravity</a>, </em>was released in early 2015 to great acclaim.

What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I live in Brookside with my wife, son and dog.  I work from home as a freelance video editor and singer/songwriter. </p><br /><br /><p>	After I drop my son off at school each morning I usually take a long walk in the park to clear my head and get a little exercise.  Then I come home and dive into whatever project I have going on.  Right now I’m just beginning work on my third album -- second with The Rabbits -- which is about half written.  When the family gets home from work/school I make dinner and then watch baseball, or in the off season, think about baseball.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/NfiGUpgWC90?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/188349651&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Your most recent album, <em>Biscuits and Gravity,</em> was released in early 2015.  What are you learning about your own craft or the recording process that has surprised you this past year?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I am pleasantly surprised that I've figured out how to produce good sounding recordings on my own without a bunch of fancy gear and almost no budget.  I’ve really learned to trust my own ears. </p><br /><br /><p>	It's taken me a long time to get to the point where I can listen to my recordings with pleasure, instead of cringing and wondering what the hell I was thinking.

What music are you raving about?  </strong></p><br /><br /><p>The Kansas City Royals!  My family. My band, The Rabbits.   Sweet potatoes for breakfast.  Black coffee.  As for music, lately I’ve gotten back into listening to jazz, which I’d kind of forsaken in favor of other obsessions the last few years.  I’m amazed by the scope of Jaki Byard’s recordings — how he embodies the entire history of jazz, from early New Orleans to the 1960s avant garde like it’s the most natural thing in the world.  You just get the feeling he and his band are having a ball playing that music.  Bill Evans is somebody whose work with Miles Davis I already loved, but now I’m finally getting around to his solo recordings. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/Kq3RsvD0xek?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What artists do you look to these days for inspiration? What do you admire most about these artists?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Randy Newman, Michael Hurley, Nick Lowe, Loudon Wainwright III, among many, many others.  I'd put Loudon Wainwright among of our greatest songwriters, but he's rarely on anybody's radar.  He can write convincingly about any subject under the sun, but his songs about family relationships are really something nobody else can even touch.  He's not afraid to reveal himself fully in his lyrics, including the aspects of his character that are not so nice.  I admire Michael Hurley because he just follows his own, quirky muse and doesn't seem too concerned about fitting in anywhere.  There are so few authentic individuals these days, when market-think has infiltrated every aspect of music-making right down to the subconscious level, to the point that most singers and bands sound interchangeable --  they don't even realize that they're adopting the same mannerisms.  We've never needed misfits like Michael Hurley more than we do now.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/guA0FG7W_ek?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/187352518&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What most excites you about music and creativity in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I don’t know if it was my imagination, but when I lived in Chicago years ago it seemed that all of the bands hated each other and that we were all in competition.  Since I came back here and finally got around to playing solo acoustic gigs about 5 years ago I’ve been amazed at how open-hearted the music community is.  A good example of that is every Monday night at The Brick, during Rural Grit Happy Hour.  They’ve really made me feel welcome, even though I didn’t come up in their scene, with all of those great bands in the 90’s and 00’s, and I'm at least a half a generation older than most of them.  On all fronts — not just music — it’s a place that seems to be coming into its own.  The only problem I see is that it’s still not a huge population center and there’s so much going on to choose from that the entertainment pie is sliced pretty thin.

I'm Nate Allen. I grew up in Roseburg, Oregon and I moved to Kansas City about 2 years ago. I've spent much of my last 10 year in a tour van learning how this rock n' roll thing works. I have currently have two main projects. ""Destroy Nate Allen"" is an interactive, sing-a-long, rock n' roll duo and a solo project ""Nate Allen"" sounds like the quiet songs at the end of loud albums when I'm not playing with a full band as The Pac-Away Dots.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>How long have you been a songwriter? </strong></p><br /><br /><p>I started writing songs when I was 15, so just about 20 years ago.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/136587539&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe style=""border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"" src=""http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3231916279/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3572444394/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://thepacawaydots.bandcamp.com/album/take-out-the-trash"">Take Out The Trash by Nate Allen & The Pac-Away Dots</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>We've been living on tour hours for the last year or so. Tessa (my wife/bandmate) and I are both self-employed so we get up around 10 and start our day with breakfast and coffee. Our home if very business focused. Tessa is a tax professional and I do small business development. My days vary quite a bit. In a given week, I'll work on music, websites, a few other business ventures and then spend time reading, cleaning house, meeting with friends. Evenings are filled with either watching Netflix or going to a shows. If I'm lucky, I'll play a few board games as well.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about your new album, Take Out the Trash. What inspired it? </strong></p><br /><br /><p>Take Out The Trash a very transitional record for me. In some ways it is a time capsule of my months leading up to our move to KC. Half the album is full band, bluesy and rocking, while the other half is minimalist and acoustic. I would say it's an Americana record. Lyrically the album deals with racism, equality, burnout, unemployment, and death among other topics all wrapped up in an at-times fun musical shell. I think of my self as non-political songwriter but I care deeply about people and as my friend shared stories with me, I started processing my privilege and awakenings through song. A friend once told me put I sugar coat even my harshest words so even with I'm writing about something extremely personal it still managed to be wrapped around a catchy hook. I wrote Trash in 2013 but some of the songs are very relevant to current social issues in Missouri and through-out the global landscape.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/9UhD30WwnR8?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What songs are you most proud of?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>""Social Equality,"" ""Westside Blues,"" ""Death is Overrated"" and ""Goodbye Letter"" are all standout tracks for me.

At the core of it all are self-reflective and socially conscious lyrics.  Are you a heavy reviser of lyrics and/or music? Or is your approach driven more by spontaneity?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>There is definitely fine-tuning process but it rarely affects the chorus, hook or flow of the song for me. I would say my revisions are minimal. I find good songs can be played in many different ways so it is really a matter of finding what suites a song best.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/j_-rAfP8oRw?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Can you point to one time in your life where you knew you wanted to be a songwriter? Who inspired you early on to write music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Up until I heard Green Day's Dookie, I hated music. But when I found punk, I fell hard and I was converted with a furious passion. That being said for the next few years, I was still much more interested in baseball and having a girlfriend than making music. I don't have any strong memories of wanting to write songs before I started and then I couldn't stop. </p><br /><br /><p>I grew up in Oregon and went to small Christian school with limited access to music so, I was particularly influenced by northwest Tooth and Nail Records scene of the mid-90's bands like Ghoti Hook, Pedro The Lion, 90 Pound Wuss, MXPX, Five Iron Frenzy, Havalina, Calibretto 13, and Danielson Famile we're all in regular rotation and great influences early on.  </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Describe your creative process. </strong> </p><br /><br /><p>I say I am more of song catcher that a songwriter. As I go about my day, a song will just show up. Lyrics, melody and chorus will tumble out in a nearly complete form. I'll grab my phone and try to capture the melody and words before I forget it. After that I'll match up some chords to the song. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3693628502/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=519975347/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://destroynateallen.bandcamp.com/album/the-eureka-recordings"">The Eureka Recordings by Destroy Nate Allen</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What tools do you use?  </strong></p><br /><br /><p>As far as tools go, I demo songs on my phone. When it comes time to make an album, I'll gather all my current demos and see what I have. At this point, I'm normally writing a few projects at once, so I sort songs based on where they would fit best. I've normally got a pretty big collection to sort through. I keep track of lyrics on google drive and organize everything in excel. I'll start refining the songs until a record emerges and then I'll do my best to capture every idea in my head for the songs. Depending on the project, I either head into a studio or record at home. At home, I record with some old mics and a KORG D888 that I've use for about 10 years. I like to seek out help with engineering because it's not my strength or passion. I am a much better songwriter than mic-placer. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>How does collaboration figure into this process?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>At this point, Destroy Nate Allen is 100% collaborative. Tessa and I co-wrote our last album in the van, on tour, before shows. I don't recommend anyone do that it definitely shaped me as an artist and person. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"" src=""http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3477014002/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3374130069/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://destroynateallen.bandcamp.com/album/with-our-powers-combined"">With Our Powers Combined by Destroy Nate Allen</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Who or what currently inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>These days, I spend more time with books and podcasts than music. I'm trying to get back in the habit of listening to music. I'm not really sure how inspiration works. It's rare that I experience something and my response it to go and create. That does happen but it is rare. I tend to be someone who internalizes events, and lessons and then as I give myself space to process life - through journaling or maybe washing dishes, a song will come. Daily life also tends to inspire me, I sing silly songs around the house and sometimes they are worth remembering. </p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Nate's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Books:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1189930036_how_music_works"">How Music Works</a></em> by David Byrne.</strong> A great book fully embodying its title, I recommend it to any musician or music lover.</p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/484750036_cash"">Cash</a></em> by Johnny Cash:</strong> The Legend in his own words.

Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>First off, I live in Wyandotte, also known as, Kansas City, Kansas. I work as a full time mother, musician, and holistic healer. A typical day for me is waking up about 8am, getting my two children (Elijah, who is 5, and Sedona, who is 1) up and ready for the day, taking them to where they will be while I am at work, then spending most of the day doing energy work, as well as returning emails and phone calls from those interested in working with me. My day ends late in the evening, usually about 6 or 7pm, and after that I am usually occupied with cleaning the house, cooking dinner, spending time with my children, and getting them to bed. Not to mention, I do spend quality time with my significant other, who I've been with for 3 years now (holla). He too is at home to help me, which is a huge plus! If I'm not too exhausted by the time the children are asleep, then I will spend some extra hours perfecting my music skills, promoting events on Facebook, and or taking some time to paint. I live a pretty busy lifestyle, as most people who have worked with me know. However, it is a very fulfilling lifestyle and I wouldn't trade it for anything.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/205806389&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/205805853&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your creative process with songwriting and recording, especially with your two albums, <em>The Other Side </em>and <em>Metamorphosis. </em> What tools do you use? What may surprise people about how your music is created?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>So you want to know about my creative process huh? Haha. It happens in so many different ways!! Sometimes I'll be strumming my guitar and lyrics will come to my head, or sometimes lyrics will come to my head and then ill come up with the melody on my guitar. My lyrics come from my life experiences, and a handful of them come from psychedelic experiences as well. When collaborating with hip-hop artists, I usually vibe with their energy for a bit and get a feel for what kind of feeling I get when listening to the song I am recording on. A lot of magical moments have happened in the studio when collaborating with hip-hop artists. It's something you would have to experience yourself to know exactly what I mean. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/zJQSGBxxMPc?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What artists do you look to these days for inspiration? What do you admire most about these artists?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Artists that I look to these days for inspiration are Tupac, Bob Marley, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, Kendrick Lamar, Amy Winehouse, and John Prine. What I admire most about these artists is how real they are. They speak their own truths about the lives they've lived and the things they've seen. It's raw, it's real, and I can relate. I also admire the music behind the lyrics. When I listen to a song, I am not only listening to what you are saying, but also to every detail about the beat and or live instruments. Their music captivates me, motivates me to stay true to myself, and inspires me to never give up on my dreams. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/205804622&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/205802349&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Your SoundCloud account has been pretty active with new music recently. How would you say your music has evolved since the release of <em>Metamorphosis</em>? </strong></p><br /><br /><p>Overtime, my music has evolved from a more folky feel to more neo-soul. Don't get it twisted though, I still embrace my folk baby side, and at most of my shows I perform both my folk music and my neo-soul tunes. Its beautiful, and I say this because over time I have created a diverse fanbase that brings a large group of very different people together through my music. Since I'm so eclectic with my style, many people ask me what musical category I consider my myself to be. I consider my music soul music, and it's not because of what it sounds like, but because of where it comes from. All of my songs come straight from my soul, and I promise you will feel what I'm talking about the second I open my mouth to sing.  </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br />      <div ><div ><br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/adrmzE5wITM?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/u8GjnJTRXqc?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />          </div><br /><br />  </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What most excites you about music and creativity in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>What most excites me about the Kansas City music scene is its diversity, support, and recent success!

A successful fashion and advertising photographer, film and TV music composer, cinematographer and graphic designer, Strong describes how every creative project requires him to be ""a good internal editor."" In this interview, Ryan discusses how he works from ""inception to fruition"" with collaborators and clients while staying true to his personal artistic vision. We are excited to share some of Ryan Strong's music and video work as well as his recommendations from the <a href=""http://www.jocolibrary.org"">Johnson County Library</a> catalog.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Ryan Strong and I live and work in Kansas City. I grew up in a small town in Illinois and moved to Missouri for university in Springfield where I studied Communications and Biblical Studies.</p><br /><br /><p>By day I handle the creative for local and nationally recognized fashion brand BALDWIN where my photography has been featured in GQ and Vogue. By nights and weekends I am a film composer and have worked on feature films with actors like Michael Madsen (Kill Bill, Reservoir Dogs), Richard Riehle (Office Space, Transformers), short films, commercials and music videos. I try to stay busy!</p><br /><br /><p>A big part of my day job at BALDWIN is being the brand’s photographer. Whether in Kansas City or New York City I concept out, book/cast models, and then photograph the clothing collection campaigns, look books, and web site imagery. I take the photos, retouch them and then design printed collateral. Inception to fruition. Outside that I design all the branding for the company, so from the labeling and packaging on the product to designing t-shirts it’s really a big playground for an artist and am very blessed to be a part of the brand.</p><br /><br /><p>Once work is finished for the day, dinner is had, music begins playing in my head and I have to retreat to my home studio to try and realize what I hear.</p><br /><br /><p>Over the past month or two I’ve been working on a suite of music for an upcoming feature film that I will be scoring with a Los Angeles director on titled The Weight. Most directors these days temp their movies with other composers tracks made for other movies during the editing process to get a temporary vibe/feel for a scene then the hired composer is brought in last minute and uses the temp tracks as a guide. The director involved me very early on in the process and we decided we wanted to create the music up front so as to not rely on or be swayed by music that was written for another story. I haven’t read the entire script so I’ve been lead by my imagination which I think can often lead to something more unexpected and authentic then writing directly to picture. Though writing to picture will definitely happen once the film is done edited. The Weight just wrapped shooting in Greenfield, MO and will come out later in 2016.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" id=""vimeo-82478673"" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/82478673?width=640&height=360&color=00adef&portrait=1&title=1&byline=1&autoplay=0&loop=0&player_id=vimeo-82478673"" frameborder=""0"" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/80554625&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You are a multifaceted artist, photographer, cinematographer, musician and composer, among other ventures, with many soundtracks to your credit. Have you always been a multidisciplinary artist? What do you see as the common link(s) between everything you do?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I started out as a graphic designer very early on in Jr. High and just slowly from that chased after many other art forms whether through necessity or curiosity. I get that question a lot about the common link and for me it has always been about simply having a good internal editor. Being tasteful.</p><br /><br /><p>Technology has made it very easy to pick up a professional camera, or acquire design software, or download the latest synthesizer. So if you have just a decent understanding on how to leverage the technology the differentiator is taste. If I’m working on something and I don’t feel it can sit next to the best artist in it’s respective trade I scrap it, start over, or move on. But I never let that discourage me. My faith has lead me to understand that all things are possible. It’s just up to you to seize it, but so often many people grow up believing the lie of impossibilities.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/0mq9xr_yVjo?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How do you move beyond creative blocks?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I don’t really believe in creative blocks. Partly because I don’t have time for them which I think is the secret. I know far too many lazy artists that feel they need to be “inspired” to create. I totally get it but it’s just an excuse from the resistance to work.</p><br /><br /><p>If I pound on the keys of the piano long enough a melody is bound to come out; or maybe if I snap a handful of photos from a few different angles with the lighting facing the opposite direction there’s bound to be a good one in there. It’s imperative you surround yourself with people who will constantly push you. And when I say push you I don’t mean pats on the back but a kick in the pants.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/YixV-rATB2s?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What or who currently inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>A good film always inspires me.

You don’t need a gig or record deal to write and record a tune, or need a client to design or photograph for. Don’t wait for college, or until your out of college, or wait until you land a creative job or project. There is an endless amount of stories to tell with your God given imagination. So get to work. Stop thinking about what you are going to do and do it. There is nothing stopping you but yourself.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1189403036_mere_christianity"">Mere Christianity</a> by C.S. Lewis.</strong> “If I find in myself desires which nothing in this world can satisfy, the only logical explanation is that I was made for another world.” One of my favorite quotes from one of my favorite books. I’ve been given so many God-given talents and I love to acknowledge the giver of those gifts.</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1092067036_ready_player_one"">Ready Player One</a> by Ernest Cline. </strong>This story is insane, if you were a child of the 80’s as it has all the best references from Star Wars to Back To The Future it combines nostalgia and technology into a dystopian novel.</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/248114036_daphnis_et_chloe_(suite_no_2)"">Daphnis Et Cholé</a> by Maurice Ravel. </strong>Probably one of my favorite pieces of classical music to which I had the opportunity of seeing it performed live by the Kansas City Symphony at the Kauffman Performing Arts. Such a beautiful emotive piece. French impressionism has taught me a lot about how to “paint” with music. Instruments being the colors and orchestration being the texture.</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/821177036_there_will_be_blood"">There Will Be Blood</a> by Jonny Greenwood. </strong>Film music as of late has become rather homogenized and this score breaks things up a bit. Love the dissonance in all the string writing, I took away a lot on writing for divis strings from this score.</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/461886036_lost_in_translation"">Lost In Translation</a> Directed by Sofia Coppola. </strong>From the cinematography, the sleepy script, amazing soundtrack, and Bill Murray I put this film on late at night when I want to be inspired. One of my favorite films.</p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1452020741","1485193577","0","0","Electronic|Classical","soundtrack music","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/ryan-strong","http://ryanstrong.com/","Learn more about Ryan's various projects here."

How has this band evolved? What have been the highlights of this experience so far?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Mime Game started as a side project during my time as the singer/lyricist for Josephine Collective. It spawned as an outlet to express ideas, musically and lyrically, that weren't stylistically fitting in the Josephine paradigm.</p><br /><br /><p>As Josephine concluded Mime Game became my main focus. Moving to San Francisco, Denver, Atlanta, and Los Angeles in the past five years, I have found myself back home starting a family and gearing up to return to the music world with a release that showcases the things I've learned and the songs I've grown to write through a lot of miles traveled and a lot of life lived. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/243565169&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/241022672&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your creative process with songwriting and recording, especially in regard to your upcoming album. What songs are you most proud of and why?        </strong></p><br /><br /><p>I usually start with an instrumental, which was how I worked in Josephine, but this time I am the one writing the instrumentals. In Josephine Collective, I would write the lyrics and vocal melodies to a blank slate the band had crafted for me. I really love being back on guitar because I've been playing for almost twenty years but was never known for it. The songs have, thusly, taken on a whole new approach when it comes to sonic composition and chord progressions. Since I start the songs and ultimately finish the, as well, I would say they are a lot closer to my heart. This album actually, as I said before, spans a lot of different places in my life, both geographically and within my head. Songs like ""Heavy Heart"" and ""Fire"" have surfaced over the last couple years and find me returning to a melodic, heartfelt approach. I have found that a lot of people respond to the more open, accessible things I write than the sprawling experimentation of Mime Game's earlier years.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/4Hd2UrDkryI?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/241022596&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What artists do you look to these days for inspiration? What do you admire most about these artists?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Lately, I find myself searching the world of alternative, indie, pop, and rock for inspiration. Current favorites include Grimes, and The 1975, though my composition ultimately falls closer to the tunes I grew up on like Jimmy Eat World and Blink-182. Another current favorite in this vein is The Story So Far. My favorite thing about any of these artists, and that seems to be a purveying theme for me, is their unapologetic nature. I love bands, artists, people in general, who live to shake the world and not for the vanity of it; rather, because they cannot seem to live happily any other way.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/bzvqj39tpVY?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/201764162&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What most excites you about music and creativity in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My favorite thing about Kansas City is the heart it holds for me. I can recant all the sound bites I've heard in recent interviews about a flourishing indie scene, the love that people feel for anything local here, the way that we have something to prove, and they would all tie into the truth about what I feel about this place. The reality is much deeper, though. This is the city that I gave me my first show in a dingy, grimy club. Kansas City is the place where everyone said, almost ten years ago, that no on could make it out of. This is the city where I proved them wrong when at eighteen years old we started negotiation with Warner Bros. Records and the city where I signed our contract the day after I turned nineteen. This is the place where both my children were born, where my family lives, and where I've found respite from the doldrums and pitfalls of a ""normal musician's"" life, time and time again. Kansas City is personal, and it has my heart. But, it also helps we have a flourishing indie scene and people are fiercely loyal to most locally born endeavors.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Dillon's recommendations from the <a href=""http://www.jocolibrary.org"">Johnson County Library catalog</a>:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/336682036_cats_cradle"">Cat's Cradle</a></strong></em> by Kurt Vonnegut</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/228592036_even_cowgirls_get_the_blues"">Even Cowgirls Get the Blues</a></strong></em> by Tom Robbins</p><br /><br /><p>Invisible Monsters by <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Palahniuk%2C+Chuck%22&search_category=author&t=author"">Chuck Palahniuk</a></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1280877036_the_1975"">The 1975</a></strong></em> by The 1975</p><br /><br /><p>What You Don't See by <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&t=smart&search_category=keyword&q=story+so+far&commit=Search&searchOpt=catalogue"">The Story So Far</a></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/352705036_american_beauty"">American Beauty</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/349626036_fight_club"">Fight Club</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/791498036_the_darjeeling_limited"">The Darjeeling Limited</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1451329541","1485193941","0","0","Rock|Indie","rock|alternative","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/dillon-devoe","https://soundcloud.com/mimegame","Hear more of Dillon's work with Mime Game here."

Emcee, Hip-Hop poet, fire performer, belly dancer, sought-after collaborator, Sara's involvement in Kansas City's arts, music and literary communities is deep and eclectic. Glass has released three Miss Conception albums with a fourth on the way. In this interview, Glass discusses how everything she does --including her work as Communications Associate for an Overland Park synagogue -- is an extension of her intensely personal yet universal creative drive and vision. Enjoy!</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourself. Where do you live and work? What does a typical day (if there is one) look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Hello, my name is Sara Glass, and I often go by the name Miss Conception!  I come from Overland Park, KS, but I feel as though my roots spread all over the Midwest.  I currently live in Mission, KS, and I work several jobs as a communications associate, and as an artist.  My main source of income comes from a synagogue in Overland Park, where I serve as the communications associate.  I handle their website, graphic design, online promotions and any communication related materials that go out to the public.  I also work as a freelance graphic designer, event coordinator, PR agent, as well as being an artist!  In my artist life, I host poetry readings, put together and perform at many kinds of shows as a DJ and emcee.  I also am a professional fire dancer (yes, I have insurance!) and I work with all kinds of circus props that light on fire!  Recently, I have been working on stilt walking and teaching workshops on circus performing.  </p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/Fire%20G.jpg"" width=""664"" height=""960"" alt=""MissConception"" title=""MissConception"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/233060700&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You are a true multifaceted artist, poet, emcee, spoken word artist, and fire performer, just for starters. I wonder what you consider to be the common link with everything you do? </strong></p><br /><br /><p>The common thread is flow.  Free-styling. Having mastery over your craft and allowing it to flow without thought is magical.  It's all about using creativity to better ourselves as people and as a community.  When are are channeling creative energy, we feel most at home, especially with the people we love.  Whether I am fire dancing, reading poetry or Djing music, there is a common thread of flowing this creative energy through oneself and coming out feeling better than before, and to me, this is why us artists do are.  There is no better high!  Especially when it comes to collaborations and working with others.  Art is essentially parallel to making magic (the good kind) and I'd wish nothing less upon a person to experience such a kind of power.  When the whole room stops and turns because of something creative you are doing, it makes everything worth it.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/HZWTjvsR5qI?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/218820036&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Talk about the connection between your poetry, songwriting collaborations and performances.   Do any of these take priority over the others?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Reading poetry is a very solo performance, but when I work with producers who make music and the poems turn into songs, there is even more energy involved.  I love sitting in with bands and letting improv magic unfold.  I would prefer to be working with a live band more so than anything else, as there is nothing more special than live instruments next to the human voice.  Fire dancing is also a very personal but collaborative effort, as it is infinitely more enjoyable with good music in the foreground, allowing the fire dancer to channel the energy and turn it into art.  </p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/Miss%20Concept%20Ion.jpg"" width=""960"" height=""639"" alt=""MissConception"" title=""MissConception"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div>    <p><strong>How did Miss Conception begin as a persona?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>MissConception began in Lawrence, KS, during college at KU.  I was writing short poems and decided to move towards spoken word.  The first longer slam piece I wrote was called ""My Main MissConception"", and I wrote a song called ""Mic Check"".  My friend called to my attention that I needed to do the Mic Check to become MissConception, and I went with that.  </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/204129371&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/135685065&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your creative process with collaborators. How do you move beyond a breakdown in communication or common vision?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Producers send me music, I see what I'm working with verbally, and usually what unfolds is just pure happen stance.  I know when a song is finished bc everything lines up perfectly and I can remember the words.  If I can't remember what I wrote, then it's usually not done yet!  Working with other performers, sitting down and participating while producers make beats, is time consuming but worth it!  Collaborating with producers is difficult because it does take time, but it's always worth it once it happens.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/IB6BqqD7eig?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Who or what currently inspires you about music and art in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Poetic Underground, a poetry open mic that I helped start at the Uptown Arts Bar,is a huge hub of creativity and performance.  I always feel rejuvenated when I attend that open mic.  (I only host once a month). KC is so full of performers and artists, there is a ton to do any given night concerning live music, and our First Friday art walks are full of creativity.  I have traveled the country, and still continue to be impressed and drawn towards the KC scene.  There is no place like home they say, and it's true in this case!  KC has two things: good people and good music.  While we may not have oceans or mountains, we sure can entertain ourselves, even in the thick of winter!</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/1512110102440075/"">Pop Poetry Book Release of ""Class Action"" at Prosperos</a>.

The songs are the center of the project, but hell, there are still a lot of guitars! It's initialed ""Preston Ott & Glass House EP"". It was recorded in 2 or 3 different studios with my engineer (Patrick Radiel) being the consistent thread of the technical side. Being a man of humble resulted in this record taking nearly 2 years to complete. Though I have had help in the process, I pride myself in the fact that I made this record with my bare hands, if you will. There is no auto-tune and no cheap tricks.

What tools do you use to write and/or record your music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My process is generally pretty introspective. I sit down to practice whatever I may be working on that week and eventually I enter a head space that is clear and safe enough for me to be vulnerable. Then something will rise out of me, maybe it's a chorus, maybe a chord progression or maybe just one word. I will sit with that for an hour or two until it grows into an idea. Once I have a foot hold I will record it on my Logic rig and return to it on a later date, that's when the real work begins. Sometimes it takes a years for an idea to come to flourishing (like the song ""You Can't Expect Much). Occasionally, if I am lucky, I feel more as the pen in the hand of a righter who must speak their mind (Like ""Hear That Rooster Crow). </p><br /><br /><p>I also find meditation to be a great tool to tame the unruly mind.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/97td4iCfEKE?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Your website lists your talents as ""guitarist, songwriter and producer.""

Do you have a preference?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>When one is alone on a stage, one is exposed. In battle, the exposed troops usually don't get a second chance. It's pretty much the same thing, except as opposed to physical detriment I suffer shame when I fail and must grow in order to not repeat this mistake. All the guitar licks and cool production are worthless if my song can not stand on its own with nothing but a vulnerable voice, a guitar and maybe some reverb. </p><br /><br /><p>But ultimately I just really love to play! So if the folks I'm playing with are mature and respectful I'll take it were ever I can get it.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/black%20dog%20photo_0.jpg"" width=""720"" height=""662"" alt=""Preston Ott"" title=""Preston Ott"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/191923639&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you the most about the Kansas City music scene?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I love how undefined the scene is.

All types of people from all walks of life can express themselves for better or worse.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Books</strong><br /><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/503166036_anna_karenina"">Anna Karenina</a> by Leo Tolstoy</strong><br /><br /><br />	This is my current read. I love Russian literature; It often can be on the darker side and because of that I feel it's strikingly honest. I love the way Tolstoy displays the psyche of his characters is incredibly elegant and artistic.</p><br /><br /><p>	<strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/84307036_notes_from_underground"">Notes From the Underground</a> by Fyodor Dostoevsky</strong><br /><br /><br />	This is essentially the transparent philosophical ramblings of my favorite author. Dostoevsky was (seemingly) in the darkest season of his life and its so brutally honest I can't help but love it.</p><br /><br /><p>	<strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/556216036_the_great_gatsby"">The Great Gatsby</a> by F. Scott Fitzgerald</strong><br /><br /><br />	Its a cliché for a reason! The Eloquence of Fitzgerald's narration is inspiring. My favorite American writer.</p><br /><br /><p>	<strong>Music</strong><br /><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1348295036_heigh_ho"">Heigh Ho</a> by Blake Mills</strong><br /><br /><br />	Blake Mills is my favorite musician hands down! More then a prodigy Mills is an unparalleled guitarist, a great writer and the most creative producer of the 21st Century. This record is brutally honest lyrically, and has some of the sweetest and most sensitive musicianship I've ever heard.</p><br /><br /><p>	<strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/205626036_innervisions"">Innervisions</a> by Stevie Wonder</strong><br /><br /><br />	A true masterpiece! Stevie's blend of musical tones and the vibe overall with this record are ground breaking.

Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Hello! The name’s Ted. I’m a composer, educator, and saxophonist living in KCMO. I’ve been living in KC for the past two years and have become infatuated with the city! Before coming to KC I was born in Minnesota, raised in upstate New York outside Woodstock, and have since then lived in Connecticut, Washington state, and the Washington DC metro. My musical background is rooted in the jazz and band tradition, and in the past 2-3 years I’ve been combining these with elements of electronic music.</p><br /><br /><p>I’m currently living in South Waldo and love the neighborhood. For work I am an adjunct instructor at KCKCC teaching music technology and multimedia, and work part-time at the music and media desk at the UMKC Miller Nichols Library while completing my DMA at UMKC. My day starts with a cup of coffee from my French press and probably 30 minutes of morning peace and quiet. I’ve found that certain pieces come to me in the morning, particularly with coffee, and the habit has stuck even if I’m not writing. From there the rest of the day is a blur of composing, listening, reading (right now it’s Steven King’s <em>Dark Tower</em> series), email, school, teaching, and a healthy dose of procrastination. I’m also a member of the <a href=""http://www.jocolibrary.org/we-recommend/listen-local/featured-artist-mnemosyne-quartet"">Mnemozyne Quartet</a> and <a href=""http://www.fuseboxnewmusic.org/"">FuseBox New Music</a>, so I’ll often have rehearsals and meetings throughout the week as well.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/130916425&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Delve a little into your own process of composing. What may surprise a listener of your music about how you create it? What tools do you use?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My process is messy. And by that I mean that what I start out intending to compose is usually abandoned or unrecognizable in the final version. I’ll usually start thinking about a piece far in advance, likely a year. During this time I’ll consider what forces I’m writing for, what is expected and what isn’t, and some non-musical idea to help guide the material. In the past one of these aspects helps formulate a concrete idea for a piece, which of course may or may not be relevant once the notes are on the page, and so far this pattern continues. Ultimately to me the most important element of music is the aural result, rather than the process or the inspiration. So once I actually start writing I focus intensely on the linear progression of the piece, especially what I call “musical momentum,” and let that determine the work.</p><br /><br /><p>As far as surprises go, I think my music already goes to some surprising places on its own. However, much of the musical material in my music for the past 2-3 years has been largely based on improvisations. Back in 2011-2013 I improvised a great deal but never really released them to the outside world. Once I develop the non-musical idea for a piece I’ll often sift through these improvisations for a small musical germ or two and then transform it into a more complete musical idea. The middle section of <em>Winter’s Summer </em>for instance was originally an improvisation, and after some editing and expansion became what it is now. Performing with Mnemosyne has also really honed in my improvising too so that now I will often improvise much of the material for a piece in one sitting and then change it as needed.</p><br /><br /><p>My most often used tools for composing are Logic X, Native Instruments, Paul Stretch, Michael Norris Spectral plugins, and a Zoom H2n recorder. When I’m not working with electronics I’ll use Finale and a piano as well.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/175001972&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Listening to your music one can hear so many different influences, especially jazz and be-bop, and even these are at times layered on top of more ambient and electronic textures (“Winter’s Summer” and “Soundtrack for an Open Road”, for example). How is your music a response to your own work/living environments? How does living in Kansas City influence your music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I’m fascinated with combining various musical elements from multiple genres, styles, or aesthetics together to make something completely new or different than the original(s). Often this results in something that suggests one style, but is layered with something else that contradicts that assumption.</p><br /><br /><p>I’ve also been training to hear pitch in noise for the past few years. I have perfect (sometimes almost perfect) pitch, which is incredibly helpful in a traditional music setting. Since I’ve started to use electronics and noise in my music I’ve wanted to close the gap between note and noise through pitch, or frequency in electronic music, and I’m now feeling more confident with it. Often I’ll hear music playing that accidentally fits into some kind of noise going on simultaneously, which I find both humorous and inspiring. I whole-heartedly suggest more people try listening to all of their environment next time they’re in a coffee shop, or even listening to music in general. Listen for how sounds fit or how they don’t.</p><br /><br /><p>I think since moving to Kansas City I’ve rediscovered my roots in jazz. Charlie Parker was a huge inspiration for me as a budding jazz saxophonist in high school. I’ve since moved on to different musical endeavors, but the music has stuck with me none the less. In addition to jazz I’ve become fascinated with the sounds of transportation. Head down to the crossroads or the west bottoms and you’ll hear plenty of cars, trains, and planes! I think those sounds are also representative of Kansas City’s industrial past, an element which I think is becoming a celebrated symbol as many neighborhoods are being revived on the Missouri side.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <a href=""https://vimeo.com/84719817"">https://vimeo.com/84719817</a>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/197459027&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>As a member of Kansas City’s FuseBox Collective, you actively advocate for new composers and performers. Talk about the challenges you see with building audiences for new music in Kansas City.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I think that one of the biggest challenges with building audiences here, and in any city really, is that all musicians are now competing for audiences with technology rather than just other performances or events. When you have a device in your pocket that is capable of delivering virtually ANY form of entertainment, high-brow or low, the question becomes: why do you go out? To me, art and music should be a kind of break from normality, something that makes you stop and consider what you see or hear. How you respond to that is of course your own decision, and I’m always curious to hear reactions both positive and negative.  Thus I think our response as creators should be to encourage an intimate and communal environment where there are no assumptions of musical or artistic knowledge and the performance is one that engages the observer more actively. <em>The Debussy Project</em> was FuseBox’s first attempt at creating an event like this, with the works being performed live in an unusual environment for music, and it certainly won’t be our last.</p><br /><br /><p>Going forward I hope to see more opportunities for performances that go beyond the norm. First Fridays and the large presence of art in this city is a prime example that Kansas City is hungry for art and entertainment beyond our devices. Why not do the same in music?</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/183893540&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/221712187&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Who or what inspires you now?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>In general it’s stories, text or visual.

At the moment I am working on a collaborative multimedia work about the sky titled Celestial Metamorphosis, and I have plans for the next few months to continue on the subject. Two experiences in my life are particularly present in my mind right now:</p><br /><br /><p>When I was 13 I was on a flight to Australia and unable to sleep. The plane was being chased by the rising sun so for over 2-hours I watched the sunrise over the Pacific and saw the light spectrum (blue, green, violet, etc.) slowly come to life.</p><br /><br /><p>A particularly volatile sunset I saw in Pullman, Washington involving a violent and ominous thunderstorm, a lightning fire, and clouds with colors ranging from sky blue to burnt orange, and blood red to black.</p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1448910341","1485194076","0","0","Classical|Experimental","classical|New Music","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/ted-king-smith","http://www.tedkingsmith.com/","Learn more about Ted King-Smith's music here."

About 3 years, a million overdubs, retaking and reimagining parts and I still think of things I would like to change about it.  I think I learned two key lessons from that album: New ideas will always emerge for songs and is part of their lifeblood, and never record yourself unless you know when to stop.  I have always enjoyed recording and mixing, being very hands on, but I feel like including objective ears in the process is really important.  Looking to the future, I imagine a more live approach to the next album.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=258026873/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=198683127/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""https://claireandthecrowdedstage.bandcamp.com/album/kamikaze"">Kamikaze by Claire and the Crowded Stage</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Many words have been used to describe your music – quirky, eccentric, unclassifiable, adventurous are only four of them. In another interview you describe the origins of The Crowded Stage as almost an accident, a collision of influences and talent, much like the musical influences you cite as inspiration.   Where does this creative fearlessness come from?  Who most inspired you early on to create music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Big question! Indecision? Lack of discipline? Poetry was one of my earliest interests, so my adventure towards songwriting definitely started there and music came later.  Probably not so much fearlessness as indecision. I've always loved the versatility of simple songs, a handful of chords that can be played in so many different styles. And I've always loved so many different styles of music... starting with my parent's diverse but small record and tape collection, but I had a lot of trouble with studying instruments as a child, I'm sure I disappointed several music teachers.  My first love was poetry, and I didn't really settle into a instrument until my sister started playing guitar in high school, and I started writing really bad, really angsty songs on it right away.  I really latched onto punk and folk music as a teenager.  After a few months of playing around on my own, I started taking lessons when I was about thirteen.  I found a lot of freedom in guitar, and the way my teachers approached the instrument, that I hadn't found with piano or vocal lessons, and I would just play all the time.  Going to college in Nashville, many afternoons and evenings and late nights were spent jamming with friends.  I started playing in bands, and just got absolutely hooked on it.  I'd play guitar or bass, sometimes drums, sometimes keys, sing harmonies, whatever.  Jill of all trades, master of none.  Approaching an instrument from a straight up creative perspective, and then filling the gaps in my technical deficit necessary for an specific part has kind of been my approach, until recently, and I think that allowed me to try new instruments and styles without worrying to much about being perfect.  The last few years, playing bass for Katy Guillen & The Girls and working with a variety of amazing musicians in The Crowded Stage, it's become more important to develop my technical abilities, musical vocabulary, and more objective skills.  That's been exciting and fun, and I'm a little bit more disciplined these days. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/Roi4NmpeoWo?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Who or what currently inspires you?

I think if you've got the software and a few decent mics, making demos at home is a great way to develop ideas.  I also think I've finally learned that a recording is an investment of so much time, creativity, and care, that it is really worth investing in a dedicated, professional engineer and a professional studio space.  We fortunately have several right here in Kansas City.  And never mix yourself, especially vocally.  But really, it just depends what you're going for.  </p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Claire's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/287804036_jitterbug_perfume"">Jitterbug Perfume</a></strong></em> by Tom Robbins</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/634454036_the_annotated_alice"">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a></strong></em> by Lewis Carroll</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/907365036_the_jungle_book"">The Jungle Book</a></strong></em> by Rudyard Kipling</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/271390036_the_wind-up_bird_chronicle"">The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</a></strong></em> by Haruki Murakami</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1221023036_the_hobbit""><strong><em>The Hobbit</em></strong></a> by J.R.R.

D brought what he had to the table, and I brought what I had to the table and I feel it just worked so well.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/MotZlHxwVek?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What other projects do you both have outside of BLKFLANL?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I’m working on an LP w/ the Lawrence, KS based beat-maker LION that we’ll release in October, along w/ an EP w/ Miles Bonny.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/256081499&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/189321750&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you the most about the Kansas City rap and hip-hop music community?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I’m inspired by the diversity in sounds of the KC hip-hop scene right now.

For this special edition of Listen Local we are privileged to feature conductor Steve Lewis and Composer-in-Residence Joseph Kern from Prairie Village's Midwest Chamber Ensemble as they discuss their craft and the nature of their creative collaboration.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourselves. What are your backgrounds? How did you come to work together?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Steve</strong>: Hi my name is Steve Lewis, I am the Music Director of the<a href=""http://midwestchamberensemble.org/"">Midwest</a><a href=""http://midwestchamberensemble.org/""> Chamber Ensemble</a> in Prairie Village Kansas. Founded in 2012, the Midwest Chamber Ensemble is an organization dedicated to the performance of chamber orchestra and chamber ensemble music of the classical tradition. Selected by audition, ensemble members are primarily young professional musicians and exceptional music students. The Midwest Chamber Ensemble prepares its members for future career opportunities by creating a professional environment and providing audiences with quality performances. I play French horn in chamber music concerts and conduct orchestra concerts.</p><br /><br /><p>I have had the pleasure of conducting the Missouri Symphony, the Wilson Symphony (NC), and the University of Missouri-Kansas City Conservatory Orchestra and Chamber Orchestra. I made my opera conducting debut in 2011 with the KC Metro Opera's production of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Gondoliers and continued work with the company conducting their 2011 production of Lehar's The Merry Widow.</p><br /><br /><p>Before moving to Kansas City in 2010, I completed my BM in music theory and composition at East Carolina University. Then I completed my MM in conducting at the University of Missouri-Kansas City Conservatory in 2012 and did advanced studies at UMKC during the 2012-2013 academic year as a conducting student of Robert Olson and a French horn student of Martin Hackleman.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/189197832&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/189197786&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>I’m interested in the creative collaboration between the Music Director and the Composer-in-Residence. How exactly do you two work together?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Steve:</strong> From my initial idea of form the Midwest Chamber Ensemble I knew we need to include local composers. The greater Kansas City area is home to many talented composers. I appointed our first composer-in-residence, Kerwin Young, for a two-year term and we premièred four of his works. At the end of Kerwin's term we assembled a committee to find our next composer-in-residence. I had worked with Joseph Kern before at UMKC so I invited him to apply. After a series of applications and interviews we selected Joseph as our composer. We have premièred three of his works and have plans to première two more and to record his new chamber symphony in May.</p><br /><br /><p>Joseph and I plan very far in advance, usually about a year out. We meet to discuss his goals and the ensemble's needs. We also have to consider how his new compositions fit in to the overall scheme of our season. Once the relative performance dates, durations and instrumentations are set it is up to Joey to get to work! Over the course of his composing he ask specific questions and ask for guidance and feed back. Six weeks before we begin rehearsals Joseph delivers parts and a score and it is up to me and the other musicians to learn the score and prepare for performance.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Joseph</strong>: I don't have much else to add to what Steve mentioned on this point as he basically spelled out exactly how things are done. The key for us is just always being in contact about the works and timelines and making sure both of us are willing to be flexible when and if needed. It's worked out very well this year and I'm looking forward to it again for the coming year.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/25457355&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Joseph, describe a typical day for you. Where and how do you compose your work? How closely do you work with either Steve or members of the Ensemble on your pieces?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My days usually start around 6:00am. I use these hours before having to go out for the day to do emails and any other sort of ""paper work"" tasks that need to be completed that day. Then I spend most of my days either at work or running errands so that by the time I'm home around 5:00pm all that is left is to make dinner and then sit down and compose during the early evening. I compose in my office and my set up is currently a 27"" iMac with another 24"" monitor that is laid out in a portrait style so I can see entire pages of larger scores. I use the program Finale (currently the 2014 version) and have a 66 key midi keyboard connected to the computer. I make it a point to play every single note that goes into a score of mine. That way, I'm working both at the computer and at the piano at the same time. If I ever have even the slightest question about if something is playable, how it fits on an instrument, or how it will sound I immediately go to either someone like Steve or a performer I know well and show them the part to get their opinion and (in the case of the performers) have them play it to show me. My goal is to write the best music I can and to make it challenging but worthwhile and the key to that is making sure it's absolutely playable.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>What do you struggle with the most creatively and how do you push through those struggles?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Joseph:</strong> My biggest struggle has always be perfection. I want each piece I'm writing the be the best possible piece I can write at that given moment. So, it's very common for me to get about halfway through a piece and decide something isn't work with it and start from scratch. While this may seem scary to some and be frustrating for me at times, I've actually found it to be a major help for my process. When I start over I'll find out very quickly if an idea I had was good because I won't be able to not use it somehow. If I can recreate what I had before without looking at it then it was worth the time I spent. However, if I can't then there was obviously something wrong and it was not worth continuing. I often feel like I haven't really begun a piece until I'm about halfway into writing it for that reason.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Steve’s recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/381615036_letters_to_a_young_poet"">Letters to A Young Poet</a> By Rainer Maria Rilke.</p><br /><br /><p>This is a wonderful little book on what it is to be an artist and how important beauty is to art.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/352810036_the_tragedy_of_julius_caesar"">Julius Caesar</a> By William Shakespeare</p><br /><br /><p>My favorite work by Shakespeare!</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/35kpk5df9780252036163.html"">George Szell A Life of Music</a> By Michael Charry</p><br /><br /><p>This is a great book on one of the most interesting conductors of all time.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/762496036_the_rest_is_noise"">The Rest Is Noise</a> and <a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1035088036_listen_to_this"">Listen To This</a> by Alex Ross.</p><br /><br /><p>These two well written books take the reader through the history of 20th Century music in the context of world history.

Bach, Beethoven, Mahler, and Ives and there is definitely a heavy influence of all of their works in my own. Outside of music I find a lot of inspiration out of early 20th and late 19th century America. My favorite art form in the Art Deco movement which flourished in the height of the 20's and 30's. My favorite poetry and literature also often comes from around the same time; i.e. Walt Whitman, Robert Frost, H.P. Lovecraft. I'm also deeply inspired by the Sacred Harp music of early America. These old hymn tunes can often find their way into my music either by simply inspiring a melody I've written, being directly quoted, or being distorted someway within the fabric of the piece.</p><br /><br /><p><br /><br />	<a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1189086036_the_mahler_symphonies"">The Mahler Symphonies </a>- Mahler and his symphonies have been a huge influence on my most recent writing and outlook on what I want my music to be and become.</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/205480036_symphony_no_2_in_c_minor"">Mahler, Symphony 2</a> - Easily my favorite of all the Mahler symphonies</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/231854036_charles_ives"">Charles Ives: A Life with Music</a> - Charles Ives is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of what the American composer can and should be.</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/421462036_symphony_no_1_hymns_symphony_no_4"">Ives, Symphonies 1 & 4 </a>- Ives' Fourth Symphony is my favorite work of his and this recording with Chicago Symphony and Michael Tilson Thomas is the best I've heard.</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/762496036_the_rest_is_noise"">The Rest is Noise</a> - Like Steve mentioned, this is one of the best books for taking someone through 20th century music which can often been difficult for the average listener.</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/316371036_leaves_of_grass"">Leaves of Grass</a> - Walt Whitman is a great American poet and a as a humanist had a great sense of what it is to both value and criticize yourself in equal parts.

His love of the recording-making process shows in the energetic studio performances he captures. Connor is a natural performer whether fronting his own band or playing solo. In this edition of Listen Local we learn more about Connor's love of the Kansas City music scene, his influences and more.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about yourself.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Connor Leimer and I'm an 18-year-old singer/songwriter from Kansas City. I consider myself a musician, guitarist, and performer with a knack for songwriting and a love for recording albums. More recently, through live shows and studio work, I've been participating in the robust music scene that KC has to offer and have successfully made a name for myself as an indie artist in the KC area.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Where do you go to school?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I'm a senior at Blue Valley North High School graduating in May 2015!</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/183979601&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/165682631&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How long have you been a musician and songwriter?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My first instrument was the drum set at age 7. So I've been in music a while, but I would practice drums so long that I eventually got burned out and looked for something new. So like many musicians, I stumbled upon my dad's acoustic guitar buried in the closet and taught myself chords which immediately evolved into songwriting. From then on, I've primarily focused on guitar and recording albums in effort to realize the full potential of my songs. Over everything else, I love to make records. The studio is where I realize the full potential of my songs and experiment with various types of instrumentation.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>How do you balance school with your creative and performing life?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My experience with school has been symbiotic. It has become a place to shop my music around and get feedback while also serving as a tremendous foundation of support among my peers. The fact that my classmates recognize my musicianship is everything to me. I was actually nominated the high honor of being ""Most Artistic"" in my class this year for Senior Superlative so my school has always been very supportive.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Describe your songwriting process. Who or what inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The thing that inspires me most is other bands and artists. I'm really just a huge fan of music. My biggest influences are people like Chadwick Stokes of Dispatch or the local KC band She's A Keeper. These are people who are passionate about what they do and have created grassroots followings among local scenes. They were some of the people that made me think I could try my hand at music. As of late, I'm listening to such bands as She's A Keeper, The Lonely Biscuits, Del Water Gap, Bahamas, Dispatch and much more.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/160559248&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You released an album last year (“Coast to Sea”) and also have an EP available.

However when I play Andean instruments, or share traditional songs with audiences or for myself, it transports me to the land that I walked hand in hand with my grandfather, where I participated in native rituals, where I watched condors fly. It also helps to have some Bolivian friends here, it is comforting to share Bolivian food or talk about our experiences here in the United States.</p><br /><br /><p><strong><em>What do you struggle with the most creatively and how do you break through that struggle?</em></strong></p><br /><br /><p>The mind can be fascinating and frustrating. When there too many thoughts in my head, they become obstacles. Nature always helps me clear my mind, so when I feel blocked its best to take a break from my workspace and connect with the energy of the earth.</p><br /><br /><p><strong><em>Where and how do you record your music? What advice do you have for others who want to do the same?</em></strong></p><br /><br /><p>It depends on the situation and the material. In Bolivia, I was fortunate enough to have my own studio, where I would shut myself in for days at a time. Now I just have a portable multi-track recorder and I master the songs on my computer. I recorded a meditation album at Lake Titicaca like that, and the quality is just fine. It´s also great for works in process. I always recommend going to a professional studio, where there are pros that know what they´re doing, but if you can´t afford it, it shouldn´t ever stop you from creating your own songs. Recording is another art form in itself, it is a long learning process to do it well, but having recording skills does help you be more independent.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br />      <div ><div ><br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/8vagouwIhew?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/IFuk8fOjP1E?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />          </div><br /><br />  </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/144209656&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/663068036_the_us_vs_john_lennon"">The U.S. Versus John Lennon</a> (DVD)</p><br /><br /><p>Music can be the most powerful instrument for change, even enough to incite revolutions and threaten governments</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/963855036_playing_for_change"">Playing for change (Peace through Music)</a> (DVD)</p><br /><br /><p>Noble mission of filmmakers and musicians to promote peace through music.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1113623036_the_music_never_stopped"">The Music Never Stopped </a>(DVD)</p><br /><br /><p>Great to watch with parents.

A Company Dancer with the Kansas City Ballet since 2011, Guerin is an accomplished composer and choreographer. Many of his original ballet and musical works have been performed by the KCB, Motion Dance Theatre in Asheville, NC, Shut Up & Dance Festival in Philadelphia, PA, and the Quixotic Dance Fusion in Kansas City. In this feature, Guerin provides insight into his creative process, his life in dance and music, and shares his book, music and movie recommendations.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>You are an accomplished choreographer in addition to composer. What does a typical day look like? Where do you get most of your creative work done?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Honestly, I get most of my best ideas for both choreography and composition in the shower! It's comfortable and safe, there's nothing to distract me, and I think about anything and everything there. It really works well for me, which sounds kind of ridiculous, but hey, gotta go with it, right?</p><br /><br /><p>I start my composition projects on my keyboard. I generally have an idea of the environment or landscape I'd like to convey, whether that be inspirational or haunting or alien or whatever, I try to have a general direction for each piece. When it really comes down to it, I end up just messing around, jamming for a bit and playing random combinations of keys, random melodies, until I find something I like and know I could turn into a full piece. I usually try to figure out a chord progression or a melody that popped into my head by playing it by ear, since I technically have no formal music training. This is the hardest part for me, laying down the basic foundation for every piece of music. I was never taught how to play the piano or what chords are ""correct"" or how to read music or anything, so I just listen very carefully, and if something sounds wrong to me, it doesn't get to go into the piece. It's strange, due to my complete lack of knowing what to do, but I think I have somewhat of a knack for knowing if something is aurally pleasing or not, and I feel like I just know what's supposed to come next. Then I'll add in different instruments on top of that base track, fading in and fading out, different melodies, a heavy percussion track, lots of cello, etc. It's really just an experimentation process, and it is so much fun. It inspires me to live my life.</p><br /><br /><p>When I put most of my choreographic work together, it is in the studio. I'll go early before my rehearsals and play my music; I'll dance around by myself, repeating sections of each piece of music over and over again, trying new movement and improvising until I find something that I like and feels right to me. I try to choreograph with musicality; that is, I try to use my body along with each instrument, or the melody that I hear. My favorite dancing to watch is choreography that uses the human body to convey the structure of the music. I want to watch things like that, and therefore I want to choreograph in that way. There are a lot of fantastic choreographers who are very good at this, such as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTnrkiZ8OXg"">Jiří Kylián</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NghGmjtxeak"">William Forsythe</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzWvkcRH8C8"">Crystal Pite</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOJy_JHDVjc"">Hofesh Shechter</a>. They're very inspirational for me, and hopefully one day I'll be as prolific as they are.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/190325906&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Who or what has influenced your creative work the most?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I have a lot of influences, such as the choreographers above, and my favorite bands and musical albums add a lot for me to think about. In a weird way, I'm very inspired by things that have happened to me, and decisions I've made, and the way I feel about them. Most of my pieces are very descriptive of an emotion or reaction that I have personally experienced. Composition and choreography are very cathartic for me; they're an expression of who I am and the things I've been through and the experiences I've had, good or bad. It might be weird to say, but most of what I create is a product of who I am at that point in time, and how I need to express myself in order to work through what is happening and the things I've done.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Describe your composition process. For example, how long does it take for a project to get from the initial stages to performance?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My process generally starts out with an internal examination of what and where my life is at the moment. I use composition and music as a way to communicate the intense feelings and emotions I have, because while I do love words, I feel they lack the necessary weight to show others how I feel. Music does that for me.</p><br /><br /><p>So once I've decided on the idea I want to convey, I figure out my basic chord progression, mostly through trial and error. This is a long process, with lots of tweaking and changing, until I've got a foundation that I'm intrigued to build upon. After that, I use the chord progression to create new melodies and new instruments as layers on top of what I already have. It really is just messing around, trying a lot of different things that may or may not work, and deciding what I like and what I don't like and then how to change it. That's the best part, making something new that literally completes what I had going before. Percussion is almost always the last thing I add, for emphasis on certain parts.</p><br /><br /><p>But in the end, I'm pretty quick with my pieces, because I knew where I wanted them to go from the beginning. It usually only takes me anywhere from 10-20 hours to complete any given work, in terms of music. Choreography tends to take much longer, just because there's so many more things to think about. Granted, it depends on the length of the piece, but choreography itself is really a full-time job.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/xCp2dC5KjwE?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/190340917&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What do you struggle with the most creatively and how do you break through that struggle?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I get musician's ""writer's block"" quite frequently. I'll have a super good idea for something, and I'll push it and push it and exhaust that direction until there's nothing left, and then I'm creatively drained. I have a weird cycle of churning out creative works for months in a row, song after song, choreography after choreography, and then I have to quit for a few months. I have to physically stop trying to make something new, because I have no inspiration. I've used up all my concepts and everything I wanted to show, and I'll have absolutely no new designs. I have to take a break. I'll just run out of ideas. Nobody can be 'on' all the time, and I can't maintain a constant flow of intelligent useful images that actually contribute towards my aesthetic. It's hard, but half my time is spent recharging.</p><br /><br /><p>And then, I'll get the buzz again, and I'll freak out about something new, some new idea I just need to put into music, to create new movement for, to become, in a way. It takes over my thoughts, my process, my feelings, everything I want to be in that moment is this new idea. It feels kind of crazy at times, but it's a feeling I wouldn't trade for anything.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Where and how do you record your music? What advice do you have for others who want to do the same?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I create all of my music on my keyboard, no matter what instrument I'm ""playing"" at the time. Then I transfer it all into my computer. One of the programs I use is Kontakt, which allows me to choose any sort of virtual instrument I'd like, while feeding it digital information about what note I want it to play. So, as I am wont to do, if I'm layering a cello track, I'm really still playing and recording it on my keyboard. My drum and percussion tracks are all just me hitting certain keys on my keyboard at certain times. It's kind of fascinating really, that I've literally created all of my music - piano, guitars, bass, strings, horns, drums - by playing the pseudo-piano. Especially when you think about the fact that I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing, and I just keep messing around with this music. I really, really love what I do.</p><br /><br /><p>My advice to others who are pursuing this, is to just keep practicing! Find what you love about your own work. I know it seems trite and obvious, but it's so true. I've been working on this for over ten years, teaching myself and looking up tutorials and listening to experimental music and watching crazy weird choreography and trying things out for myself, you have to keep trying. You need to be respectful, but you need to fight for what you want. You need to love what you do, more than anything you've ever loved before. You need to create music for yourself, music that you'd want to listen to on a road trip. You need to create choreography you'd want to see your favorite companies performing. You have to seek out opportunities to present yourself, you have to seek out places where you can be creative, you have to seek out chances to fail and chances to succeed. You just have to fight for it. You will get there, I promise, as long as you have a vision and a heart and the will to succeed.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/187191680&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/186128408&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Travis's recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Books:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1173647036_invisible_monsters_remix"">Invisible Monsters</a>, Chuck Palahniuk</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/623976036_galpagos"">Galápagos</a>, Kurt Vonnegut</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1008543036_darkness"">Darkness</a>, stories chosen by Ellen Datlow</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1123261036_machine_man"">Machine Man</a>, Max Barry</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Music:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1132687036_the_devils_walk"">The Devil's Walk</a>, Apparat</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/751072036_friend_and_foe"">Friend and Foe</a>, Menomena</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1098681036_burst_apart"">Burst Apart</a>, The Antlers</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1203417036_the_haunted_man"">The Haunted Man</a>, Bat For Lashes</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/791534036_in_rainbows"">In Rainbows</a>, Radiohead</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/158355036_little_earthquakes"">Little Earthquakes</a>, Tori Amos</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Movies:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1045195036_requiem_for_a_dream"">Requiem for a Dream</a></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1025804036_a_single_man"">A Single Man</a></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/611912036_cach"">Caché</a></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/549343036_the_machinist"">The Machinist</a></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/531503036_closer"">Closer</a></p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1425323138","1484779068","0","0","Classical","choreography|ballet|classical","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/travis-guerin","https://soundcloud.com/travisguerin","Enjoy more of Travis's music here."

I'm a Kansas City based musician and recently a new mama! :) I've been touring and writing music for the past fifteen years and have recently made my first solo album.</p><br /><br /><p>We are extremely fortunate to welcome singer-songwriter <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/iamKristenMay/?fref=ts"">Kristen May</a> to Listen Local.

Touring has been such a magical journey for me. Getting to see America and other parts of the world, has been exhilarating, mixed with the excitement of sharing my music with new people. I feel so blessed to be able to live my passion and make a couple bucks doing it!</p><br /><br /><p>Lately, my life involves a lot of time enjoying a four month old adorable, chubby mister named Graham. I find time to write new tunes here and there, but mostly I'm singing to an audience of one. Graham is after all, my biggest fan ;)</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246251075&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You recently completed a PledgeMusic campaign for your recently released Conversations, after years on a major label with your bands Vedera and Flyleaf. Can you speak to how your new songs were either inspired by or helped inspire some creative risk-taking? What have you learned from seeing through this risk that would help other artists follow your path?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>When I began my journey as an artist, it was very much in a grassroots way. I pressed my own CDs, sought out venues in Kansas City to give me a gig, I hung out after the shows and sold my own merch. This continued with my band Vedera. We were lucky enough to catch the attention of a booking agent and manager who hooked us up with some tours, and off we went. It wasn't until about four years into our career that my band, Vedera signed to a major label. There are certainly some positive attributes to signing to a big label. Good distribution, money to support you while you tour, connections with people in the music industry, and you know, free clothes and swag ;) I also had the opportunity to work with some wonderful producers and artists because of my connection with our label, Epic Records.</p><br /><br /><p>So, for awhile it worked out pretty good to have a label looking after us. But, the downside of course is you have to share in some of the money you earn. You have to for the most part, listen to people's opinions of your art and let them have a share in it. This can be all well and good but sometimes it can cause a problem if you aren't seeing eye to eye.</p><br /><br /><p>So for my solo record, I weighed all my options and decided for me, putting out my album on my own was the best way to go. Pledgemusic is a company who interested me because they are all about letting you have control of your art. They are also really good at helping you have the power and they have good ideas on how to share that power with your fans. Putting my album out with Pledgemusic really helped me connect with my fans in a unique way and bring them in on the making of my album like never before. To me, there were really no creative risks.

I'm not sure why, maybe the fact that I was pregnant for the first time. That created a new kind of magic for me. The life inside me was helping to create life in my music. I'm usually pretty picky when it comes to my songs and sometimes I have a hard time finishing what I start. There are hundreds of voice memos on my phone and demos on my computer that may never see the light of day. But, for this album, I was connected somehow to a pretty vibrant stream of musical consciousness and the creativity was flowing, thankfully. :)</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246250699&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What artists do you look to these days for inspiration? What do you admire most about these artists?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I love Joni Mitchell, Sarah McLachlan, Simon and Garfunkel, The Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Coldplay. These are some musicians I will probably always listen to, because I really enjoy their songwriting. I love melodies that feel like they stand the test of time.</p><br /><br /><p>New artists I enjoy are Joy Williams, Ed Sheeran, Ben Howard, Laura Marling. These artists have beautiful voices and know how to tell a good story. I'm also a sucker for a good song about heartbreak and these artists really know how to go to that vulnerable place and create a gorgeously sad song.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/wGjvPL5otUs?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What most excites you about music and creativity in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Being in the Midwest, as opposed to the coasts, I think people operate less on trends here. I think that can create some really honest, unique art. I'm excited about people collaborating here in the city and local radio like the Bridge supporting our artists. People like Chris Haghirian, who really have a passion for promoting local music, are what make this city special. As well, as your show here. It makes a difference to have this kind of support! I hope this movement continues to spread and more people listen to what Kansas City and Lawrence musicians have to offer!</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/AvgPbHEcoto?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Kristen's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>1. <strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1328795036_big_little_lies"">Big Little Lies</a></em> by Liane Moriarty.</strong> This woman writes page turners. Suspenseful, witty writing with great character development. Sooo much drama, and though there are certainly some serious topics involved, somehow she always makes me laugh.</p><br /><br /><p>2. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/522707036_garden_state"">Garden State</a> (DVD)</strong></em> . I went back and re-watched this movie the other day for maybe the tenth time. This movie made me fall in love with Zach Braff's writing/directing/acting and of course Natalie Portman is wonderful as well. Funny, heartwarming, bittersweet and triumphant. I love this movie! Plus, the soundtrack is killer!</p><br /><br /><p>3. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/422829036_tapestry"">Tapestry</a></strong></em> <strong>by Carole King.</strong> ""You've got to get up every morning with a smile on your face and show the world all the love in your heart...""</p><br /><br /><p>I was singing these lyrics from Carole King's track ""Beautiful"" to my son the other day and was inspired to put this album on. One of my absolute favorite pieces of music forever and always. Every song is a hit. Beautiful, raw, honest. Carole King's melodies are just so good. She's one of the reasons I wanted to start writing my own songs.</p><br /><br /><p>4. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/415343036_ina_mays_guide_to_childbirth"">Ina May's Guide to Childbirth</a> </strong></em><strong>by Ina May Gaskin.</strong> While preparing to give birth to my son at home, a friend who also had a home birth, recommended this book to me. Ina May Gaskin is probably the most popular midwife out there. She has done so much to empower women to take steps toward natural childbirth and I loved this book. Its very insightful and is loaded with tools to help you if you are looking to give birth with little or no medical intervention.</p><br /><br /><p>5. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1076084036_downton_abbey,_season_1"">Downton</a> Abbey: Season 1 </strong></em><strong>(DVD)</strong>. I recently went back and re-watched this series from the beginning. I love this show. The casting, costumes, hair, landscapes, drama, script...everything. I think I was interested so much in this show at first because it is so different from my day to day life. I really felt transported into another world. But, the more I watched, the more I felt a connection to many of the characters, no matter where they are in the class system. The actors do a great job on this show. Stellar stuff. I also, want to get the <em>Downton Abbey</em> cookbook and try some of the desserts from the show. The meals are so extravagant!! Well, the whole show is extravagant. I'm so sad its over now.</p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1465409138","1485190276","0","0","Singer - Songwriter|Pop","pop|singer-songwriter","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/kristen-may-0","https://www.facebook.com/iamKristenMay/?fref=ts","Learn more about Kristen May here."

Recalling the haunted sounds of Mark Kozelek, Jason Molina and Leonard Cohen, Watson has toured widely as a performer and has grown as an artist and musical collaborator. He recently released a brand-new song, ""Natural Ice"", and plans on more upcoming projects, which you can read more about in our interview below with the man himself, in addition to his generous selections of music recommendations.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Doby Watson. I live in a tiny room in a house with a bunch of dogs (that aren't mine) just north of midtown, but I'm barely there. Every day is different, but always busy. If I'm not working on music, I'm wishing I was.

Talk about this new music and other songs you’ve been working on since 2014’s <em>Live- In Son.</em></strong></p><br /><br /><p>That EP with Austin and Margo was a lot of fun. Both are longtime friends of mine. Margo and I were touring last summer and stopped in Minneapolis where Austin was living. We brought Austin (and his dog, pictured on the cover) with us to Milwaukee, where another old friend of mine, Cory Schulz, lives. Cory setup some equipment in his living room, and we spent a couple of afternoons playing together while he recorded it.</p><br /><br /><p>I just finished an EP and I've got a handful of collaborations in the works. I've got a lot written that I'm sitting on.

What do you admire most about these artists?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>That's tough to answer. I don't think about it like that. I just do my thing. I admire a ton of artists that sound nothing like me and a few that do. I'm sure I'm influenced by all of them in some way. People say I sound like Mark Kozelek, and I really like his music (not sure about him as a person), but I didn't know who he was until people started comparing me to him. I love the DIY spirit and general weirdness of some contemporary rappers, but I'm not about to emulate them. Guess I'm probably most directly influenced by close friends like Austin.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/PAMSo6NynuM?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Can you point to one time in your life where you knew you wanted to be a songwriter? Who inspired you early on to write music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I didn't necessarily aspire to be a songwriter, it just happened. When I was a kid I loved making noise and played guitar in hardcore bands. I got tired of relying on other people so I started messing around with shoddy home recordings. Through encouragement from friends I put some stuff online - next thing I knew I was touring all over the place doing DIY shows. The more I traveled the more people I met who encouraged me to push myself to become a better singer and songwriter. I've still got a ways to go, but this music thing is definitely my favorite thing.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/TgG-YDul4rI?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What excites you most about the Kansas City music scene?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>When I'm in KC I tend to keep to myself, so I don't have a great idea of what's going on.

As I developed a style, the platform for my music evolves out of organic performances, I build layers of textured effected guitar notes, loop them and improvise over and add more textures creating a bed of sound to let the listener lay in. As I started to perform more live, I realized the best way for me to focus on my sound and not be distracted by an audience was to turn my back to them and engulf myself into the sounds I was creating each set.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=509717508/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=4182947453/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""https://exposeventy.bandcamp.com/album/frozen-living-elements"">Frozen Living Elements by Expo Seventy</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You recently expanded Expo ’70 to include a drummer and bassist.

She has performed widely in and around the Kansas City area, including the Kauffman Center and Fox 4, as well as in Nashville. She also has a growing body of work and mature approach to her craft that belies her age. We're happy to share Kate's music and videos with you on Listen Local.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about you and your work.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I am Kate Cosentino. I'm 16 and a sophomore at Blue Valley West High School. I love playing video games, making art and music. I've always had a love for music and am a huge bibliophile/logophile, so writing has always been a passion of mine. I've been playing guitar and singing (formally) since the first grade. My music is a conglomeration of all of the styles I listen to, jazz, indie, alternative and pop being the most prominent. I like to write songs because they're art for the ears. It's really beautiful to me that I can write a song that means a certain thing to me and means something completely different to someone else. People are really important and fascinating to me so whenever my music touches someone in some way, it's the most surreal experience. That being said, I write a lot of serious story songs but I've also written songs about Batman and Indium, so I do laugh once in a while haha.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/187088689&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/187088518&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Where have you performed?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I have performed at Take Five Coffee Bar, the Italian Festival, KC Superstar, several different fundraising events, the Vivano Variety show, on FOX 4, Old Shawnee Pizza, the Commodore in Nashville, the Kauffman Center in the opera Turandot and several others. On January 30th I'm releasing my new EP, Smart, with a concert at RC's in Martin City and everyone is invited!</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Describe your songwriting process.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Most of the time when I write, a lyrical idea of subject just randomly hits me. After that I'll vamp on the guitar and just start singing until I come up with a melody and the words flow out right. Then I add and edit and add etc. On the other hand, if i'm not struck with an idea, I will sit down and brainstorm. I come up with a bunch of little things until something sticks. Typically if I figure out a prompt I like, I'm pretty speedy and creative!</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>How do you balance school with songwriting?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>School and music have gotten a little harder to balance as I've hit high school. I'm involved with a lot less school activities and devote more of that time to music. I also incorporate music into my school day by taking choir and teaching myself theory in Gifted or study hall. I'm fortunate that I don't struggle very much at school so I can devote a lot more time to music.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Who are your musical influences?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The one artist who truly inspired me to start writing was Regina Spektor. I'd never heard anyone do such creative things with their voice and write the weirdest, most unique songs. And they just WORK somehow! I think she is really phenomenal. I also really enjoy Bombay Bicycle Club, Nellie McKay, Snarky Puppy and the list goes on and on. Witty lyrics, risky moves and just pure art really keep me going.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/187089433&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/187087251&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Kate's Recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>1. <a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1218409036_a_clockwork_orange"">A Clockwork Orange</a> by Anthony Burgess</p><br /><br /><p>I am a huge fan of this classic book. I am also a language nerd so reading a book containing its own language (nadsat) got me hooked immediately. The questions this book raises about violence, crime, the treatment/rehabilitation of criminals and human morals and motives captivated me.</p><br /><br /><p>2. <a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/411950036_scranimals"">Scranimals</a> by John Prelutsky</p><br /><br /><p>This book was my favorite growing up. Sometimes I still check it out for the nostalgia of it. I love the artwork and the creativity of this book. You get taken on an adventure to this crazy new world and I love it every time.</p><br /><br /><p>3. <a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/344392036_dovey_coe"">Dovey Coe</a> by Frances O'Roark Dowell</p><br /><br /><p>I read this book when I was quite a bit younger but it really stuck with me. I'd never read something written in this way and I really felt like I was inside the mind of Dovey Coe. It was cool to see her grow up as I myself was growing up. Plus the story is really unique.</p><br /><br /><p>4. <a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1294331036_short_term_12"">Short Term 12</a></p><br /><br /><p>I originally saw this movie on Netflix but was very excited to see it was offered at the library. This movie really moved me because it displayed how regardless of your age, you can still have emotional problems and still be haunted by the past. It also had a great message of how important it is to care for other people and to be kind.</p><br /><br /><p>5. <a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1025798036_mary_amp_max"">Mary & Max</a></p><br /><br /><p>I watched this movie of recent as I am a huge fan of claymation. I really love how creative the animation is, how creative the characters and set are and how unlikely the relationship between these two pen pals is. Oh and of course Phillip Seymour Hoffman. End point.</p><br /><br /><p>6. <a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1158512036_making_sense_of_people"">Making Sense of People</a> by Samuel H. Barondes</p><br /><br /><p>In a nut shell, this book deals with the science of how our personalities form backed by several experiments and studies. I loved reading about our memory in particular and how sometimes we alter our memories based off of how our personality and beliefs are currently. Definitely makes you think!</p><br /><br /><p>7. <a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1319684036_lazaretto"">Lazaretto</a> by Jack White</p><br /><br /><p>One of my favorite albums and favorite writers. Anything Jack White, all the time. The lyrics on this record in particular are very fun and brilliant.</p><br /><br /><p>8. <a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1311469036_st_vincent"">St. Vincent</a> by St. Vincent</p><br /><br /><p>Annie Clark is an inspiration to me in guitar, music and fashion. She is zany and wicked smart. Definitely worth a listen.</p><br /><br /><p>9. <a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1191303036_invisible_stars"">Invisible Stars</a> by Everclear</p><br /><br /><p>One of my favorite things to do is to pick a random album from the library and leave it in my car, making it the only thing I listen to as I drive. This was one of the randoms and it was very different from hat I typically listen to. I really enjoyed the singers voice, the vibe of the music and the crazy lyrics.</p><br /><br /><p>10. <a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/657939036_the_mysterious_benedict_society"">The Mysterious Benedict Society</a> by Trenton Lee Stewart</p><br /><br /><p>This is one of my favorite books of all time. It shows that people are gifted and smart in different ways. It constantly gives the reader riddles to solve. This book brings out the genius in everyone and also the adventurer.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/QP2_r4hFcTc?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1424199938","1484779126","0","0","Singer - Songwriter|Folk - Americana","singer-songwriter|guitar|folk","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/kate-cosentino","http://k8cosentino.com/","Learn more about Kate and her music at her website."

We are pleased to share some of Caleb's original songs with you, along with an interview and some of Caleb's personal recommendations on Listen Local.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about yourself and your work.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I grew up in Merriam, KS, playing music from the time I was 10 years old. After I moved to Los Angeles at 18, I really started to pursue music as an art form. My main goal with my music is to explain to those around me what I'm going through, and if I can help even one person through something similar, or make them feel like they finally have a voice then my career is complete.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Describe your songwriting process. How do you make time for music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Songwriting is a very bare and honest thing for me. The songs I write are like small glimpses of whatever is going on in my mind at that time. Sometimes they're about missing someone, sometimes they're about feeling insecure in my life, and sometimes they're excited at the thought of something. It usually starts with a single line, from a conversation or a book, and I just know 'I've got to write that'.</p><br /><br /><p>Making time for songwriting is difficult. I oftentimes find myself picking up my guitar at 1 or 2 AM because that's the only time I have lined up that I can play for a little bit. As you get older all hobbies become more difficult to make time for, so I go out of my way too set aside at least a few hours a week where it's just me and my guitar.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/170987966&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Where have you performed?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I've played a lot of coffee shops on the West Coast. If I could pass on a piece of advice to any young performer who wants to start playing but doesn’t know where to start, it's play literally ANYWHERE. Open mics, in a park, at a party, anyone who wants to hear you needs to hear you. I once played at an outdoor farmers market in the Ivanhoe district and that was one of the most enjoyable performances I remember.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Who are your musical influences?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My musical influences range from Coheed and Cambria, to Dave Hause, and Jason Lancaster. Frank Turner and Wil Wagner have had a lot of influence on my songwriting process. The most influential person in my personal career has to be Taylor Crawford. I can't count the amount of times that she has pushed me too my potential, and encouraged me to keep my head up when things looked rough.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/195362561&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Caleb's Recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/284342036_the_old_man_and_the_sea"">The Old Man And The Sea</a></em> by Ernest Hemingway</p><br /><br /><p>I think this book really illustrates the futility of the human search for success and serves as a reminder to me to just enjoy the time I have here and not work so hard.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><em><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1077753036_frankenstein"">Frankenstein</a></em> by Mary Shelley</p><br /><br /><p>Classics like this are the reason I still have faith in art in all of its forms.

A music composition student at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, Harbison composes his music on either piano or guitar, depending on the kind of music he is working on. This multifaceted approach to his craft is rooted in the deep study of musical composition theory and form as well as the art of the performance. You can check out his album <a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1371805036_songs_from_my_shelf"">Songs From My </a><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1371805036_songs_from_my_shelf"">Shelf</a> from the<a href=""http://www.jocolibrary.org/""> Johnson County Library</a> catalog. Read on for an interview with AJ and to listen to some of his music.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about yourself and your work.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I am a composer and singer/songwriter living in Kansas City with my lovely wife and baby daughter. We moved here in the summer of 2013 for me to pursue a graduate degree in music composition at UMKC, and it didn't take long for me to fall in love with the city, particularly its great love and support for the arts. I have one foot in the ""concert music"" world and one foot in the ""pop music"" world, and this has always informed the way that I write in both genres. My concert music incorporates a lot of harmonies and rhythms idiomatic to pop music, and in turn my pop music draws on my concert music education in considerations of theory and form. I've composed in concert music genres from solo instrumental pieces to large choral and chamber ensembles, and will be completing my first orchestral piece in 2015. On the pop music side, I've performed in coffee houses, living rooms and on larger stages, and in 2010 I released a CD of original music that I wrote, recorded and produced myself. The visual arts have always held a fascination for me as well, and I have ideas for several future projects dealing with the interaction between visual art and music.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117694137&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117694074&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How long have you been composing music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>When I was eight years old, I began taking piano lessons, and the final exercise in my first theory workbook was to compose a short piano piece called ""Pharaoh Built A Pyramid."" I eagerly took on the challenge and have never looked back. I picked up the guitar as a teenager, and wrote my first pop song as a final project for a German class in college. Since then I've usually focused more on one or the other at various times, but I love them both and plan to continue writing in both styles throughout my career.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Describe your songwriting/composition process.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>When composing a piece of concert music, I usually start with a single idea—a character or an image or a feeling I want to convey. I've tried various methods of mapping out a piece from the beginning, and some are more helpful than others, but often I find in the writing that the music takes over and leads me where it needs to go. In songwriting, I always begin with the lyrics, and usually finish writing them before I pick up the guitar or go to the piano to work out the music; but by the time I'm done with the lyrics, I normally have a pretty good idea in my head of how the music will sound.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What or who inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My Christian faith has always been a strong source of inspiration for me, with the richness of its imagery and symbolism and the depth of its tradition. In 2013 I wrote a concert piece for chamber orchestra and drum set based on Lent, the 40 days leading up to Easter, and themes of faith permeate my pop music as well. In the concert music world, I'm inspired by composers like John Adams, Morten Lauridsen and Eric Whitacre, who are exploding popular misconceptions of what ""modern music"" sounds like and are writing music that people who have no formal music education or experience with classical music can love. One of my composition professors at UMKC, Chen Yi, is also inspiring in the way that she takes traditional Chinese folk music materials and combines them with a mastery of Western compositional technique, which is another form of what I'm trying to do in blending concert and pop music. In terms of pop music, I'm inspired by bands like U2 and Coldplay who can skillfully marry profound words with infectious music, and songwriters like the Indigo Girls and Derek Webb who elevate the craft of lyric-writing to its highest form. Visual art, literature and dance are also great places for me to find musical inspiration, as are the beautiful trees, parks and architecture of Kansas City!</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/152865420&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1423163138","1484779259","0","0","Uncategorizable","guitar|choral","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/aj-harbison","http://www.ajharbison.com/","Learn more about AJ's music here."

A junior at Raytown South High School, Isaac brings an ambition and skill to composition that demands attention. He not only composes and transcribes the pieces he writes for the Raytown South Symphonic Orchestra, he conducts the orchestra as well. Isaac is a multi-instrumentalist and someone who is deeply interested in evolving as an artist. It's our pleasure to introduce you to Isaac Barkley.</p><br /><br /><p><em>Tell us about yourself and your work.</em><br /><br /><br />	Isaac Barkley. I'm 16 years old (junior in high school) and I've been composing music since 1st grade. My compositions include piano solos, orchestral pieces, hip-hop/rap songs and beats, etc. I enjoy listening to many different styles of music and I like to reflect those in the music I write.</p><br /><br /><p><em>Where have you performed and who has performed your work?</em><br /><br /><br />	I've performed some of my piano compositions in recitals and the symphonic orchestra at Raytown South High School (which I play the violin in) has performed two of my orchestral pieces.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/185904148&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><em>What's your composing process like?</em><br /><br /><br />	When I compose, I start with a small idea. Once I think of that idea, I have to get it down on paper or a recording before I forget it. It's nothing forced. Then, I take that small idea and expand it with more complex ideas and emotions. And in the end, I have a completed and satisfied result. When I first composed, I transcribed my music on staff paper. Now I use programs to write my music including Finale, Garageband, and Logic Pro.</p><br /><br /><p><em>How do you balance school with composing?</em><br /><br /><br />	I compose music year round. This year, I have the pleasure of being able to write music during part of my school day. I'm taking a two hour Digital Media Technology class at Summit Tech Academy. In this course, I am able to explore new music programs, and I'm learning how to mix and produce music.</p><br /><br /><p><em>Who are your musical influences?</em><br /><br /><br />	My musical influences include producers such as Gawvi from Reach Records, orchestral composers such as Hans Zimmer, and piano soloists such as Yiruma.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/185904146&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>","0","437","1","1421348738","1485535790","0","0","Classical","classical|orchestral|piano","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/isaac-barkley-2","http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/community/816/article4398019.html","Read the Kansas City Star's recent article about Isaac."

Isaac was the <a href=""https://www.jocolibrary.org/we-recommend/listen-local/isaac-barkley-interview"">very first artist we featured on Listen Local </a>back in January, 2015, and now has the honor of being our 100th. For this interview we catch up on what Isaac's been up to and how his craft has evolved over the past year and a half.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about what you’ve been up to since we last interviewed you in January, 2015.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Since January 2015, I have finally completed high school! Graduating was one of the best moments of my life, and I am so happy to take this step in my life. Throughout the past year, I have enrolled in college, hung out with friends, participated in many school events and sports, been hired at an amusement park, written more music, and tried (successfully) to keep my grades up.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Your music has taken a turn away from the classical and orchestral towards EDM, techno and pop-oriented songcraft. What inspired this turn?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Haha, I actually haven’t taken as big of a turn as it may appear when it comes to my styles of music composition. Ever since I started writing music, I have created songs of many different styles/genres. For several years, I have had a passion for creating music of both orchestral type (like piano and other string instruments), and electronic type (like EDM, hip-hop, and pop). In my early years of composing, it was the orchestral type songs that got the most public attention, mostly because they were the ones that were performed live in recitals or concerts. In the past couple years, my electronic songs have gotten more attention than before because more people have noticed my Soundcloud page and I have done some live performances with them. I actually have written many more electronic songs than I have orchestral. I do enjoy writing electronic music more than orchestral as well. I won’t stop writing both styles though, and I like to combine the different styles in songs together.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/270103407&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/270101859&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/206208800&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You accomplished a lot during your last two years at Raytown South High School. What were some of the challenges you faced trying to balance academics, preparing for college and staying creative?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Junior year, there was no problem with balancing academics and music creation. I was enrolled at Summit Technology Academy and took the Digital Media Technology class that I went to for half of every school day. In that class I learned skills in audio and video production, and it is the best class I have ever taken. I gained so many skills from taking the class and I greatly furthered my music education. I was able to write music almost every day with access to a couple different studios we had in the building and different recording equipment.</p><br /><br /><p>Senior year was a different story. It was very hard to balance academics, preparation for college, music creation, and other things like sports or family events. I was enrolled in three dual credit classes along with other high school classes, and I didn’t go to STA for Digital Media again because it was a one year class. I tried writing music on my own but I struggled to find time to do it. In my busy schedule this year, I was able to write a couple new songs though. I wrote a third piece for my high school orchestra that was played in a concert and I created a new EDM piece that won popular vote in an Indaba Music contest. Other than those two, I didn’t complete very many songs at all during my senior year. However, I was able to continue gaining skills in audio production in a couple different ways. Last year I became the lead for the sound crew in my high school’s theater productions and I also was the audio editor for my church. I was able to continue using skills I learned from my Digital Media class in various ways.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>You’ll be studying Music Technology at the University of Central Missouri</strong><strong> in the fall. What drew you to this program? What are you most interested in learning once you’re there?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I want to continue my studies in music so I plan to major in Music Technology. I was drawn to this program because I have such a great passion for creating music and using audio production technology. I believe this course will help push me towards a career in music production. My goal is to someday work in a music studio and create new music with various artists.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p>My music has been inspired by artists such as Martin O’Donnell, Gawvi, <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Alesso%22&search_category=author&t=author"">Alesso</a>, <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Garrix%2C+Martin%22&search_category=author&t=author"">Martin Garrix</a>, <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Lecrae%22&search_category=author&t=author"">Lecrae</a>, Michael Salvatori, <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Guetta%2C+David%22&search_category=author&t=author"">David Guetta</a>, and <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Capital+Kings+%28Musical+group%29%22&search_category=author&t=author"">Capital Kings</a>.

Currently the director of the KC-based Balinese Gamelan Semaradana community ensemble Gamelan Gentra Kasturi, Conway has also for decades been involved in many different projects as composer and/or performer with a focus on creating a fusion of music from Western, Asian and African elements. We are honored to share an interview with Patrick Alonzo Conway on Listen Local.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. What is Gamelan Gentra Kasturi? What role do you play?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Patrick Alonzo Conway. I am a freelance musician/composer who has been working in Kansas City professionally since 1986 in a variety of guises including classical bassoonist, folkloric percussionist specializing in AfroCuban music and Balinese Gamelan, and conguero in salsa bands and world beat/funk bands. I also have dabbled in the world of saxophones mainly in avant garde ensembles.</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://www.gamelangentakasturi.org/"">Gamelan Genta Kasturi</a> is a community gamelan ensemble performing on a Balinese Semaradana gamelan set that was built for, and still owned by, UMKC. When UMKC received the set in January of 2003, they also brought a Balinese teacher, I Ketút Gedé Asnawa and his family, from Bali to teach courses at UMKC and start a community ensemble. This type of gamelan was created in the mid 1980's and allows for the playing of differing styles of Balinese gamelan that would normally require totally different sets of instruments. I have been director of the ensemble since Mr. Asnawa completed his stay at UMKC in May of 2006 and moved to University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, where he currently resides with his family and teaches. I conduct rehearsals and produce performances with the group.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/UYCmKaTt0N4?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/56364362&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/14185314&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Gamelan Genta Kasturi performs both traditional Balinese gamelan music and your own original work. How is the new work created? What is the nature of the collaborative process with the group’s music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I have created new works in different ways depending on the time/context. Initially, I wrote gamelan works that fused other world musics (AfroCuban) with western instruments and gamelan, which is tricky due to the tuning of the gamelan. I initially would trade sections between the gamelan and western instrument consorts (AmeriCuBali 2004 & Sekar Purwa Pascima 2006). I did expand Sekar Purwa Pascima in 2007 to include woodwinds in combination with gamelan and expanded the modal palette in the woodwinds. My next step was to try to write in Balinese style just for gamelan, but with an extended palette that included harmony (Masked Dance 2010) and full 7 tone applications (Blossoming Dance 2010). Another fusion experiment of mine occured in 2012 with gamelan/big band combination created for our group and Black House Collective.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about the collaborations GGK has done with other musicians, dancers and visual artists.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>2011 was a big project entitled <a href=""http://www.gamelangentakasturi.org/angels--demons-at-play.html"">Angels & Demons at Play</a> that combined projected visual imagery, original choreography/dance based on Balinese dance styles , poetry of Sun Ran with original music created by myself that incorporated gamelan pieces and other sections/arrangements of Sun Ra for non-gamelan instruments.</p><br /><br /><p>Other collaborations have included a combo with CSF visiting artists Nagual (Sycamore House series) in fall of 2013 and Quadrigarum in spring of 2014. These pieces were based on improv structures created collectively with our group members and the two other groups.</p><br /><br /><p>We also combined my <a href=""http://www.gamelangentakasturi.org/10th-anniversary.html)"">Blossoming Dance</a> with shadow imagery by Nihan Yesil in 2013 for our tenth anniversary concert.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/t8Dy5pII608?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/13945528&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What projects are in the works for GGK?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>We possibly will collaborate with sound/visual artist Dwight Frizzell (KCAI faculty) this fall on a piece entitled The Bridge, which may be site specific and incorporate live gamelan with amplifications of sound emanating from the bridge crossing the MO River on Highway 291 on the east side of Independence, MO.</p><br /><br /><p>Also, we have been discussing doing a series of fun drive in style Monster Movie themed puppet shows with live gamelan accompaniment in collaboration with Mesner Puppet Theater, though this is a longer range project that may be a couple of year away.</p><br /><br /><p>My primary focus is producing a series of main spring concerts featuring our founder/teacher I Ketút Gedé Asnawa and his family for the next 4-5 years while they still reside in the States.

A Kansas City native currently living in Lawrence, Stremel's most recent song, ""Orlando (Keep Dancing)"", is a moving tribute to the lives lost and survivors of the mass shootings there in June. Stremel was kind enough to share some insights into her art and other current projects.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Kristie Stremel. I am a singer/songwriter based in Lawrence, KS.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>You recently released the song “Orlando (Keep Dancing)” as a direct response to the recent shooting tragedy, a song you wrote and recorded soon after the events. Tell us about writing the song itself. What has been the response to it by your fans and newcomers to your music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I wrote the song with my partner as a way to process such a horrific mass-murder. After it was written, I played it on the radio / EIGHT ONE SIXTY on 90.9 The Bridge the next day. The host, Chris Haghirian posted the video he took with his cell phone on Facebook and many people started to watch it and share it. I then recorded the song and released it all in the same week. I am donating half of all iTunes download sales to the victims in Orlando. I think man people are connecting with the song as a way to begin the healing process. When something so devastating like that happens, it’s sometimes hard to find words to identify feelings and I think the song helped people in that way.

After five years composing, studying and teaching in Kansas City, Chan very recently left the area to teach at Ball State University in Indiana. In this interview, Chan illuminates his creative process, how he approaches the many different aspects of music composition he works in and what he appreciates the most about his time in KC.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Chin Ting Chan. I also go by Patrick. I am originally from Hong Kong. I have been residing in Kansas City for five years, teaching at the Kansas City Kansas Community College (and previously at the University of Missouri - Kansas City and Bowling Green State University in Ohio). I am a composer of acoustic and electroacoustic music. I travel frequently both nationally and internationally to attend performances of my music. Besides being a professional composer, I am also an audio engineer. I have mixed audio works for professional CD publications as well as live sound re-enforcement. I will be taking the position of Assistant Professor of Music Theory and Composition at Ball State University in Muncie, IN beginning this Fall of 2016.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>You're a multifaceted and prolific composer who's tackled everything from large ensemble, to chamber, solo and electroacoustic works. What do you see as the creative challenges inherent in each of these disciplines?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Different instrumentations create different compositional problems/challenges as well as possibilities. Usually, the larger the instrumental combination is, the more complex colors a composer can create/combine with; it, though, does not necessarily mean that it is harder to compose. I often find it harder to write a convincing solo piece than, say, a large chamber ensemble piece. For orchestra pieces, it is a whole different genre, as it has such an abundant amount of repertoire before us that we need to be aware of, which could then become the most challenging aspect of writing it; and also, the time it involves to write such a large piece is massive: one has to be able to stretch his/her creative process over a long period of time to finish a piece like this, and it is this time-consuming/consistently-banging-the-music-in-my-head aspect that makes it particularly hard for me. Also, when you work on the same piece for a long time (a lot of the time spent on formatting the score, orchestrating sections, etc), you could confuse musical time with actual time, which makes it more even time-consuming and difficult...</p><br /><br /><p>I especially enjoy writing small/medium-size chamber pieces the most as it could give me enough instrumental/coloristic variety without having to waste too much time on sectional orchestration.</p><br /><br /><p>With electroacoustic pieces, it heavily depends on the theme and technical specifications I'd like to work with. When you have enough materials to work with, the creative process could come quick; but it is often scary as electroacoustic music basically encompasses any sound in this world (I record my own samples); it could be daunting if you don't start with some limitation to the sounds or some sort of inspiration or themes.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/231119876&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/201929564&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What tools do you use for composing? What may surprise a listener about how your music is created?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I usually only have my mechanical pencil and a bunch of staff paper with me. It may be surprising that I often do not use a piano because it is not portable - I cannot bring my piano to a coffee shop to compose.</p><br /><br /><p>As for electro-acoustic music, I record samples of everyday-life sounds, process them on my computer and compose in my studio at home with a good pair of speakers/headphones, mixer and interfaces.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>How do you move beyond or through creative blocks?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>When I encounter creative blocks, I usually stop working all together, take a walk outside and do something completely unrelated - it could be something non-creative, or something creative like taking photographs to stimulate my creativity again.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>What inspires you the most about the Kansas City classical music community?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Kansas City has such a diverse group of audience. People go to all sorts of concerts and are willing to accept different musical styles and interact with the artists. The art scene here is also vivid, with lots of inter-disciplinary collaboration opportunities. The classical music community is also very supportive, and we have different organizations (Friends of Chamber Music, the Kansas City Symphony, to name a few) bringing in world-class musicians - it's never been a better time to be a musician living here!</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/161738658&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/233259306&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Chin Ting Chan's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/314195036_repons"">Repons: Dialogue De L'ombre Double</a></strong></em> by Pierre Boulez</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1234645036_meanwhile"">Meanwhile</a></strong></em> by Eighth Blackbird</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/289852036_private_gardens"">Private Gardens</a></strong></em> by Kaiji Saariaho</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/254713036_concerto_for_piano_and_orchestra_concerto_for_cello_and_orchestra_concerto_for_violin_and_orchestra"">Concerto for piano and orchestra ; Concerto for cello and orchestra ; Concerto for violin and orchestra</a></strong></em> by Gyorgy Ligeti</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/142708036_black_angels"">Black Angels</a></strong></em> by Kronos Quartet</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>This one I’d actually like to check out, seems like an interesting documentary about one of the most influential composer/thinker in the 20th Century:</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1226139036_john_cage"">John Cage: Journeys in Sound</a></strong></em> (DVD)</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/148462333&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1473357938","1485194315","0","0","Electronic|Classical|Experimental","classical|experimental","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/chin-ting-patrick-chan-1","http://www.chintingchan.com/","Learn more about Chin Ting (Patrick) Chan's music here."

Their recently released EP <em>It's Just a Game</em> is filled with the kinds of pop hooks and production that any fan of Fall Out Boy, The 1975 or Neon Trees will love. For this edition of Listen Local, Ingram was kind enough to answer some questions about the band's busy summer, the recording of their new EP, and what's ahead for the band, in addition to their Johnson County Library recommendations.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourselves and the band. Where do you guys live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Our drummer's name is Andrew Hosler and he is the oldest in the group, he just graduated high school. All of us are still students and don't really work unless its during the summer or part-time. Tommy O'Halloran is our bassist and is a new addition to the band as of a couple months ago, he goes to Rockhurst High School. Our lead guitarist is Rylan Fisher and he goes to Blue Valley West High School with me. He's also only 15 years old! I'm Jack Ingram and I am the vocalist, rhythm guitarist, and synth player for the band. We all live pretty close together in the Leawood area and have grown up together playing in a worship band at Church of the Resurrection.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Describe your creative process with songwriting as individuals and as a band. How do you break through creative blocks? How do you handle creative differences?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>As the main songwriter of the band, I usually come up with a main theme for a song and bring a chord structure, lyrics, and melody to the band so that we can all jam on it. Then together we'll write leads, and figure out the backbeat and bass line of the song. Usually to blow off some steam and to keep from killing each other during songwriting sessions we will go outside and ride ATVs ha-ha. But we are all really good friends and hangout a lot outside of practice so we are usually pretty good about getting along with each other.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/206119492&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/206119688&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Where was your new EP, “It’s Just A Game” recorded? What was that process like?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>We recorded ""It's Just a Game"" with my good friend Christian Horton. Christian just graduated from Blue Valley West this year and is an amazing audio engineer/producer. We recorded and produced the entire EP in the studio in his basement. It was a really long process and required me going back and forth to his house to redo parts, and occasionally rewriting leads. Although we all agree that recording is one of the best parts about being in this band.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Who or what has been the biggest influence(s) on your band’s music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>We are all pretty diverse when it comes to our music tastes and it kind of blends into our indie pop-rock vibe. Andrew and I grew up listening to classic rock because of our parents and it kind of throws a little bit of old school fashion into our music. Rylan has been playing in church longer than any of us and you can really see how that comes across in his playing. He's always concerned about being in tune/balanced with the band and having good tone. Tommy loves the Red Hot Chili Peppers and has been inspired by Flea. Some bands we all like are Fall Out Boy, The 1975, Walk The Moon, From Indian Lakes, and Phoenix.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What’s on the horizon for Tall Tales?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>We have a lot of shows coming up this summer! We're playing a fun show at Martin City Brewery this Friday night followed by two sets of Porch Fest. Then I'm going out of town for awhile but we'll be headlining the Granada on July 2nd when I get back. We're going to be writing a ton of new music this summer and hopefully we'll get a chance to release a single or two this summer. We are also hoping to release a full length album next year.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/206119777&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/206119440&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Tall Tales's recommendations from the Johnson County Catalog</strong>:</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?t=author&q=walk+the+moon&commit=Search&searchOpt=catalogue"">Walk the Moon</a></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&t=author&search_category=author&q=fall+out+boy&commit=Search&searchOpt=catalogue"">Fall Out Bo</a><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Fall+Out+Boy+%28Musical+group%29%22&search_category=author&t=author"">y</a></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?page=1&q=%22Mayer%2C+John%22&search_category=author&t=author"">John Mayer</a></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1280877036_the_1975"">The 1975</a></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Phoenix+%28Musical+group+%3A+France%29%22&search_category=author&t=author"">Phoenix</a></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1256309036_i_love_you"">The Neighbourhood</a></p><br /><br /><p>Hippo Campus</p><br /><br /><p>Circa Waves</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/206119850&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/204244549&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1435773941","1484775921","0","0","Rock|Indie|Alternative","rock","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/tall-tales","http://www.talltalesband.com/","Learn more about Tall Tales here."

Sharples's songwriting and instrumentation on Off-Center's debut EP, <em>Transparency</em>, belies his 18 years of age with melodies and hooks fans of Death Cab for Cutie, early Metric and indie pop fans everywhere will love. We are happy to share an interview with Grant about his craft, the making of <em>Transparency,</em>and what lies ahead for him and Off-Center, in addition to Grant's personal recommendations from the <a href=""http://www.jocolibrary.org/"">Johnson County Library catalog </a>and links to his music.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourself. Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Grant Sharples and I’m an 18-year-old kid from Kansas City. I just obtained a part-time job at a clothing store called Tilly’s in Town Center. Considering it’s part-time, I don’t work every day so my typical day always involves music. Sporadically throughout the day I’ll go to my room, pick up my guitar or bass, and continue to work on the project I’m working on. Right now I’m working on new material, so lately there’s been plenty of songwriting to consume my time. I also attend three music lessons a week; drums, guitar, and piano.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>The production on Off-Center’s new Transparency EP is quite accomplished. How did you learn to record your music? What do you enjoy the most about the recording process?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>If I produced the Transparency EP myself, it would be of much of lower sound quality! I worked with this guy named Duane Trower. He’s the head guy at Weights and Measures Soundlab in downtown Kansas City. Both my friend and guitar instructor were talking about him and telling me to go record with him. I contacted Duane and shared my ideas with him and we met for the first time in mid-November. It was a wonderful decision because Duane is an incredible producer. He’s really good at mastering and achieving a level of sound quality that’s pretty uncommon for most local producers. For example, on “Objects in Mirror Are Further Than They Appear” I was conveying these thoughts to him on how I wanted this grand, bombastic 80’s sound. He got that exact sound I was describing to him and I’m really happy with his production on the EP in general.</p><br /><br /><p>I’d have to say my absolute favorite part of the recording process was hearing my music come to life. Personally, songs begin as ideas. They incessantly play in my head until I actually have the opportunity to record them. So when I finally recorded some of them, it was stunning to hear those ideas that were roaming around my mind for a long time blossom into full-blown works.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=927358318/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3935642879/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://off-center.bandcamp.com/album/transparency-ep"">Transparency EP by Off-Center</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How did Off-Center start? How did you begin working with singer Kate Cosentino?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I began writing my own music in 8th grade. I didn’t realize at the time, however, that I wasn’t good at it! Nevertheless, I continued writing and subsequently developed my songwriting skills. After three years of writing songs, I had quite the catalog of musical works. Yet, there was one major issue: I couldn’t sing. I could write lyrics, play all the instruments, compose all the parts, but I couldn’t sing.</p><br /><br /><p>I was playing drums at a show at Music House (the place I take lessons at) and heard Kate filling in for an absent singer. Her voice was individualistic and stood out among the crowd of vocalists performing that night. I contacted her on Facebook later that week and we exchanged phone numbers. Eventually, we met up and discussed musical ideas and I showed her some of my songs. I’m so lucky I met her because she is an amazing vocalist and I couldn’t have released this EP without her voice.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Describe your creative process in terms of songwriting. What tools do you use? How do you break through creative blocks?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My creative process always begins on the guitar. The majority of the time, I won’t even by trying to come up with a new idea for a song. I’ll be playing for fun and improvising and then I’ll stumble across a phrase that sounds pleasing to my ears. Everything else stems from that one phrase. I’ll come up with chords, a bassline, and drums in that order. The final thing I always do is write lyrics. It has always been easier for me to write instrumentals first and vocals last. I think of the instrumentals as the foundation. It sets up the primary melody you hear in the song and it sets some ground rules for the vocals. I feel that you allow yourself to be more creative with the main melody when you set certain limitations. You force yourself to think outside of the box because you can only use certain tools.</p><br /><br /><p>Occasionally, I’ll think of lyrical ideas and themes that intrigue me and quickly file them into the notes application I have on my phone. I also have an application on my phone that lets me record these phrases and chord progressions so I don’t forget them. It’s extremely frustrating when you forget that catchy hook you wrote seven hours earlier that day!</p><br /><br /><p>Frankly, I encounter plenty of creative blocks. While it’s quite bothersome and annoying, I’ve figured out a method to break through them: patience. You can’t force creativity out of yourself. In fact, I believe that when you try to force out a song when you’re uninspired, you’re making yourself less creative. Sometimes, I’ll just be watching TV or reading a book and suddenly, I start coming up with ideas. It’s strange really, because I won’t even be trying to write music when I come up with these ideas. It may sound stupidly simple, but it’s 100% true. Ideas just come to me when they’re ready. Yet, some of these ideas take a much longer time to fully flourish into a complete song. For example, I wrote all of the parts for the song “Transparency” in an hour. On the other hand, it took me two weeks to write all of the parts for “Objects in Mirror Are Further Than They Appear”. The individual parts for the latter simply came to me intermittently throughout the course of those two weeks. As for the former, it only took one hour for all of the parts to come to me.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=927358318/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=443118621/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://off-center.bandcamp.com/album/transparency-ep"">Transparency EP by Off-Center</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Who or what inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>For me, inspiration comes in two different formats: musical inspiration and lyrical inspiration. First, I’ll talk about what inspires me on a musical level.</p><br /><br /><p>Some of my favorite bands to listen to are M83, Twenty One Pilots, alt-J, Bear Hands, and Tame Impala. That list is likely to change next week, but who knows at this point? There is a plethora of artists in this world that make extraordinary, breathtaking music. These artists that I admire and respect are the ones that inspire me to create music. Often, I will listen to a song and fall in love with it. Next, I look up the live version of it on YouTube. Then, I think to myself, “You know Grant, you need to write an Off-Center song and try to make it at least as half as cool as this.” While I’m unsure if the final product ends up even being half as cool as an M83 song, it still ends up being something I’m proud of. It’s something different than an M83 song, it’s an Off-Center song.</p><br /><br /><p>As far as lyrical inspiration goes, I’m intrigued by lots of different things. The idea that people’s views can differ to such an extremity is interesting to me. We are all human, but each one of us is an individual. We have individualistic personalities, tendencies, and likes and dislikes. The gamut of my lyrical inspiration ranges from personal uncertainties to my views on how society conditions everyone to virtually be the same person. When I begin writing the lyrical portion of a song, I enter the process with a clean slate and allow myself to be inspired by anything that comes to mind.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What do you have in store for Off-Center fans in the near future?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The difficult thing about being a solo artist is that you have to recruit a band to perform live, which is something I’m currently working on. I’m also going to be working with the videographer who films for a local band called The Greeting Committee. As far as new material goes, I’m working on making new music at the moment. I have several songs already, probably enough to make another EP to be honest, but recording music is expensive and I plan on saving the bulk of my money for my first year of college. I’m going to be heading to Columbia, MO in the fall at MU. I plan on trying to immerse Off-Center in the local music scene there once I head down. As of now though, I want to make Off-Center a staple in the Kansas City music scene, and hopefully I succeed!</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/Tkc6NbdyI0w?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=927358318/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=117529336/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://off-center.bandcamp.com/album/transparency-ep"">Transparency EP by Off-Center</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Grant's recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Music:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>1. <em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1132980036_hurry_up,_were_dreaming"">Hurry Up, We're Dreaming</a></em> by M83</p><br /><br /><p>2. <em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1306643036_morning_phase"">Morning Phase</a></em> by Beck</p><br /><br /><p>3. <em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1204032036_an_awesome_wave"">An Awesome Wave</a></em> by alt-J</p><br /><br /><p>4. <em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1255012036_trouble_will_find_me"">Trouble Will Find Me</a></em> by The National</p><br /><br /><p>5. <em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1107478036_torches"">Torches</a></em> by Foster the People</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Books:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>1. <em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1242694036_a_constellation_of_vital_phenomena"">A Constellation of Vital Phenomena </a></em>by Anthony Marra</p><br /><br /><p>2. <em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1376467036_the_lost_boys_symphony"">The Lost Boys Symphony</a></em> by Mark Andrew Ferguson</p><br /><br /><p>3. <em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1374154036_girl_in_a_band"">A Girl In A Band</a></em> by Kim Gordon</p><br /><br /><p>4. <em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1330787036_california"">California</a></em> by Edan Lepucki</p><br /><br /><p>5. <em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1324734036_cataract_city"">Cataract City</a></em> by Craig Davidson</p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1435169138","1484776059","0","0","Rock|Pop|Indie|Alternative","pop|rock","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/grant-sharples","https://off-center.bandcamp.com/","Listen more of Grant's music here."

A composer of hip-hop and electronic music, Harlan is the co-founder of the Kansas City-based record/media distribution production company <a href=""http://www.deflektrecords.com/"">Deflekt Records</a>. He also created the <a href=""http://www.harlanray.com/thefeed/"">Up the Ante Project</a>, a non-profit fundraising organization geared towards helping those in need through the selling of clothing he designs. In our interview, Harlan discusses his creative pursuits and why knowing his limitations and listening are crucial to making art. It is a pleasure to welcome Harlan to Listen Local.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourself. Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Harlan Ray, I'm an artist from Shawnee, KS. I currently live in Kansas City, KS and I'm in the freelance art & design field. A ""typical"" day is non-existent in my particular life/lifestyle. I've been fortunate enough to be able to wake up to a truly new day. Get introduced to new experiences and have the ability to constantly learn and grow. The only thing that's typical I suppose is the need for food and water...</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>According to your website, you have many projects going on: music, acting, clothing design, philanthropic ventures, in addition to running and building Deflekt Records and Rikkachet Productions. How do you maintain a creative focus with everything you do?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>First starting out in all of this at the age of 13-14 I was always focused too much on the ""big picture,"" and when you do that you can become extremely overwhelmed in thinking that the entirety of your work needs to be accomplished the very moment you thought of it. Anything creative, dealing with art or performance, etc. is intertwined with the human condition therefore it takes time, sometimes quite a bit. After realizing this, the older I became, I learned to take everything one day/one moment at a time. There is never a right time for anything, procrastination is a killer!</p><br /><br /><p>Of course I'm not alone in regards to the building of Rikkachet Productions and especially Deflekt Records. Mikhail Marchenko, Serge Nevsky, Sean Calhoun & Alexander T. Buettner have been a very supportive and creative help with these two facets. Artist' Mikhail Marchenko & Serge Nevsky are the force & face of Deflekt as far as I see it. They bring definition to the name and brand.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/75342956&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/110911376&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Like the wide variety of projects you are involved with, your musical styles are all over the map. Describe your creative process with songwriting and composition. What tools do you use? How does collaboration with other artists figure into this process?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Well, the process of a song and/or composition is not always the same, at least not with me. It can change with who I work with or the type of track it is. Generally though, especially lately, it'll begin with a word, phrase or title. Then I start attaching my own experiences and feelings with that, then I head straight to the Pro Tools rig and start working immediately on the track, Pro Tools is my main DAW. As soon I start hearing something that provokes any type of emotion through the speakers I start writing lyrics, the composition doesn't even need to be done. I write till the lyrics are complete, record it (lay it down), then start adding more to the track to give it a better blend with the vocals and lyrics. However like I said, the process can change, that's a workflow used if it's just me working on something solo.</p><br /><br /><p>There's only so far I can go with music and/or art, knowing my limitations is crucial. So, bringing in other artist' who know what they're doing better than me can make for an overall better product.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>How do you break through creative blocks?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I believe that barriers or blocks are caused somewhat due to trying to rush the creative process. What's known to have worked for me is to step back from the piece, allow myself to relax and get back to a state of enjoyment that I had when I first initiated the idea then the barriers start to lower and dissipate on their own.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What can you tell us about the science fiction novel you’re working on with Mikhail Marchenko?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>It's just been a lark...for now anyway. That project in-particular has been a slow work-in-progress. The novel was already initiated by Mikhail, then I got invited into it after the main idea had already been established. There's not much to discuss right now, it's too fragmented story-wise.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Who or what inspires you the most?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>People. Human beings are remarkable. Filled with so much pain, contradictions, stories, passions, egos, sympathy, empathy, hate and LOVE. I don't think I can pigeon hold my answer to this into one thing. You can also get inspired by anything and everything by simply listening. At a very young age I noticed that I didn't talk a lot. That's hindered me in some ways because I have a difficult time sometimes speaking my mind. However, my not being vocal was due to me constantly listening. I absolutely love listening, you have no idea how much one can contribute to a conversation or fixing a problem just by taking in others points of view. Listening is powerful. It's the one common tool in our arsenal as humans that is the most overlooked and ignored.</p><br /><br /><p>Do more listening, you'll figure it out...</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br />      <div ><div ><br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/SRugpymE5y0?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/eaARPp7AwfU?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />          </div><br /><br />  </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/204092362&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Harlan's recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1171855036_words_like_loaded_pistols"">Words Like Loaded Pistols</a></em> by Sam Leith<br /><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/295177036_the_greatest_generation"">The Greatest Generation</a></em> by Tom Brokaw<br /><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/481497036_charlie_and_the_great_glass_elevator"">Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator</a></em> by Roald Dahl<br /><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/372880036_wild_at_heart"">Wild At Heart</a></em> by John Eldredge<br /><em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_of_the_Doomed"">Songs of the Doomed</a></em> by Hunter S.

The film reflects DeBose's deep love of music, the artists who make it, and the city that inspires its creation. The film is a true labor of love and signals uncommon talent. Watch ""Almost There"" below and enjoy an interview with its creator.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong><em>Introduce yourself. Where do you live and go to school? What does a typical day look like for you?</em></strong></p><br /><br /><p>I'm Kharrington DeBose. I live in Overland Park, KS. I just graduated Olathe Northwest and will attend Kansas City Art Institute in the fall. Since it's the summer, a typical day for me is just talking to my family and surfing the web and going to work.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong><em>Much of the video work you’ve posted online has strong connections to music. What do you like most about working with musicians? How has music inspired your own creativity?</em></strong></p><br /><br /><p>What I liked about working with musicians, especially if I got them performing in front of a crowd or just anyone that hadn't be around them before, was seeing the other people's reactions. With Reach, people were dancing in the street and stopped traffic basically. When I filmed Atlas, it was really great because I had two of their biggest fans along with me and in the recording you can hear them singing along and getting excited when they played their favorite songs. When I saw Taryn perform, I took my dad with me and he was really impressed. To this day, he still says that she has talent. Other than seeing other's reactions, working with musicians was really interesting because they all had different perspectives of everything and even though they were different in genre and age, you could tell they all have a passion for music and making music.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/IJBeSWMnO48?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong><em>Describe your creative process. What tools do you use? How did you learn how to use them? What do you struggle most with creatively?</em></strong></p><br /><br /><p>Since I wrapped up Almost There, I've been using Spotify and my sketchbook to write down ideas while I listen to certain songs and stuff. I also watch a lot of music videos and if I can, I reach out to the DPs and directors and ask them questions about the production and what inspires them, similar to this. During my high school career, I used Final Cut Pro X and Canon 60Ds and Panasonics that were provided to us by the school, being a part of the e-Communications program. I was in the entertainment video class and use that time to learn more about the editing program and equipment.</p><br /><br /><p>For me, I don't want to be stuck doing the same thing over and over again. I want to make something great, but I don't want to be stuck in the same box of doing something. In the video class during critiques, someone said ""You can tell Kharrington did this video"" and it bothered me. I don't like having a signature style because then I feel like everyone thinks they've seen it all. I don't want them to think I'm a one trick pony. I've only just started.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong><em>What advice do you have for those what want to do what you do?</em></strong></p><br /><br /><p>Don't let failure keep you from doing what you want. I never got first place in anything in high school for anything important, but you have to learn that not everything you do is going to impress everyone. Though, my documentary didn't impress judges, it impressed a lot of prestigious colleges and even an international band, alt-J. As long as whatever interests you makes you happy, I say keep on doing it and understand that nothing in this world is handed to you. Also don't be afraid to ask questions and reach out. I didn't know half the people in my documentary until I just put myself out there and asked if they were interested. Same with alt-J. They won't know if you don't ask.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong><em>Who or what inspires you?</em></strong></p><br /><br /><p>I used to say that Sofia Coppola was my inspiration because I liked Marie Antoinette and the production, but it was that superficial. Right now, my inspirations are limited in a way. I appreciate everyone and their views in film, but I think I'm a bad film student because I don't watch movies and my inspirations don't stem from that are more in musicians like Dev Hynes and Toro Y Moi. I really like Dev's music (Blood Orange) and his style and am aspiring to have style levels like him one day.

Where do you live and go to school? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Hello! My name is Gracie Schram. I’m 16 years old and I go to Blue Valley North High School. A typical day is actually kind of tough to describe because a lot of my days look different. Some days I’m sitting in class learning about calculus and physics, while other days I’m performing in front of thousands of people. I am still trying to figure out how to balance being a high school student and a traveling musician. My brain is always racing and I often have to remind myself to take a second and just breathe. I won’t lie, what I do is sometimes really hard. I miss out on a lot of the things a “normal” high school student would experience and I am away from my friends and family pretty frequently. It’s also a ton of work to travel, go to school, and pursue a music career all at the same time. I spend lots of time talking to teachers, coming in early to take tests, and spending late nights preparing for upcoming shows. It can be stressful and overwhelming, but I wouldn’t trade it for anything. I am so grateful for the opportunities I have to meet incredible people, travel to new places, and perform all over the country. I feel really lucky that I get to do what I love.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/146312646&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your creative process. What tools do you use? How do you break through creative blocks?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Creativity is something that is ongoing for me. I’m constantly writing down new ideas and if you ask anyone in my family I’m also ALWAYS singing. When I sit down to write a song I usually start with some kind of idea. I find if I know where I’m going with the song it’s a lot easier to finish as opposed to wandering around for an idea to land on. I spend a lot of time in Nashville and I do tons of co-writing there. Typically I’m a fairly fast writer. I’ll sit down in a room with another writer, I’ll share my idea, we’ll get to work and usually 2 hours later we will have a song. It’s the most magical process to go into a co-write with just an idea and come out with piece of art, a song. I think for me what stops creative blocks is just keeping my eyes open. Paying attention to situations in my life, listening to stories, people watching, and even reading billboards as I’m driving on the highway. You never know what could spark an idea. I also keep an ongoing list of song titles, lyrics ideas, and hooky melodies to go back to if I feel like I’m out of ideas.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about the process with making your first album,<em> i am me</em>. What lessons have you learned that you’ll take to future projects?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I had the honor of working with Grammy award winning producer, Charlie Peacock on my debut studio album, <em>i am me.</em> Charlie has produced some of my all-time favorite artists like, The Civil Wars, Switchfoot and Kris Allen. I recorded <em>i am me </em>in Nashville at Charlie’s studio, The Art House. His studio is in an old church and as you walk up it feels like you’re entering into Narnia. You walk down this curvy path through his garden with twinkle lights hanging above you. It’s magical to say the least. It easily set the tone for my creativity and I instantly knew I was recording at the right place. On the first day in the studio, I expected us to sit down and talk about how the process of recording would go. I couldn’t have been more wrong. Charlie’s first question was, “What are we singing today?” I was caught off guard and it felt like my eyes bugged out of my head, but I quickly realized I needed to take the lead. The first song that came to my mind was “Wallflower” and it became the first track on <em>i am me</em>. By allowing me to lead, I grew and learned so much as an artist during this process. Recording with Charlie was much different than any recording process I have experienced. He allowed for me to sing my vocals and then he built the songs around them. Throughout the entire process I felt as if Charlie and I were on the same page with every aspect of creating this piece of art and he allowed for my fingerprints to be all over the album. My album, <em>i am me</em>, is the first thing I have done musically that I am extremely proud of. I’m so grateful to Charlie for creating this album with me and it was an adventure I will never forget.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/y6O84_xX_oY?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How do you see the library as helping foster creativity -- your own as well as in the community?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The library is no doubt a place filled with immense creativity. Just think of every story written inside each book. During my high school career I have really enjoyed my English classes. Reading novels like <em>Les Miserables</em> and <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, having not only brought inspiration to my songwriting but they have also caused me to become a deep thinker. I know I have learned so much from literature and the library is a place where everyone can do the same.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Who or what inspires you the most?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>From a musical standpoint, the artist that has inspired me the most is Ingrid Michaelson—her voice and her style of writing has been something that I’ve admired and studied ever since I was little. I own every one of her records, and I’m not ashamed to say I know all the words to every song. Back in October she came to KC for a show, and I opened for her. I got to talk with her and I sang the encore with her. It was a dream come true—a total bucket list moment.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Gracie's recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1225556036_eleanor_amp_park"">Eleanor and Park</a> By Rainbow Rowell</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1183990036_pride_and_prejudice"">Pride and Prejudice</a> By Jane Austen</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1150239036_the_fault_in_our_stars"">The Fault in Our Stars</a> By John Green</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/240214036_les_mis%C3%A9rables"">Les Miserables</a> By Victor Hugo</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/965522036_the_great_gatsby"">The Great Gatsby</a> By F.

Calvin Arsenia is a mainstay in the Kansas City music scene. A multi-instrumentalist who is equally at ease behind a harp or guitar, Arsenia is a powerful songwriter and performer. Read on to learn more about Calvin's approach to his craft, his recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog and, perhaps most important, listen to some of his music.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. How long have you been a musician and songwriter?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Calvin Arsenia. I've been singing for as long as I can remember. When my brother was an infant, I sang this song to him about how cool his name was in comparison to mine. His name is Reuben meaning ""behold the son,"" and my name means ""bald"" as in <em>lacking hair. </em>You can imagine how six-year-old me felt gypped in the name potency department.</p><br /><br /><p>It wasn't until my preteen years that singing became a focus of mine. Then, at 13 I started playing piano and guitar. I'd write songs from time to time but in 2010, I released the EP ""Hands"" and have released a few recordings since then.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Describe your songwriting process. Who or what inspires you the most?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Most of the time the writing process comes very naturally. I do a lot of car-singing. I'm not sure if I should be so open about that. Maybe it's perfectly normal! Rather than listening to music, I use car rides to deal with whatever emotion is prevailing at the time and that means singing. Music and lyrics always come at the same time and if I can remember it later on I assume it's good enough to work with. I'll let a phrase rattle around in my head for a couple weeks before I build chords around the melody.</p><br /><br /><p>A couple of artists who inspire me are Bjork and Sufjan Stevens. The music that these artists make is unapologetically honest and thoroughly their own. I really respect that. Because of this perceived sincerity, it required a few listens before I started to really enjoy the music. It's more like a fine cooked meal than fast food. I aspire for that in my own music.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/DrSKruohDME?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/188538126&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You are a multi-instrumentalist and singer, in addition to performer, songwriter, poet and lyricist. Did all of these talents evolve naturally? What do you struggle with the most creatively and how do you break through that struggle?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I forget that these things exist as separate entities. For me, they sort of flow into one another. What I'm about to say could be a bit controversial, but I believe music is so fundamental in the human experience that it is only as good as its ability to communicate a message to another person. That's not to say it all must be easy to listen to - some emotions are so full of distortion and dissonance that in staying true to that emotion, its hard work to hear. Whether its hard rock, blues, classical, or pop, sincerity in music speaks to a foundational humanness and that should be guarded at all costs.</p><br /><br /><p>In my own progression as an artist and songwriter, conveying musical ideas has been a journey. It's very easy to clutter up a sound space, leaving no room to breathe, but I have to remember to keep it simple and only include what is required. This means a lot of trimming, letting it grow some, and trimming it again.</p><br /><br /><p>Something else that has been a slow but rewarding process is the role as a performer. Again, I believe sincerity wins here. I have a background in classical music and church music. These types of music in particular are such that the performer is the vessel the music is coming through; the composer or the deity is to take center stage. In my own music, being able to convey emotion and revisit the headspace that compelled me to write a song in the first place is always the struggle. These are my stories. Hopefully, in being able to address them head on, others might be able to do the same in their own lives.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>You released an EP last year (“Prose”) and also have two other EPs available. Where do you record your music? What advice do you have for others who want to do the same?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>""Prose"" was recorded in Edinburgh, Scotland, with a group of musicians called Calvin Arsenia and the Earls of Grey<em>. </em>A friend of mine, who also played cello in my band, used the album for his university project studying audio engineering. I also have recorded with producer Warren Jurgens of Meridian Sound and Sam Shurling, a local electronic musician. Both are local and incredibly talented. (There have been others, but these are the people responsible for the EPs you've referenced here.)</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/77257888&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/119972342&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Where are you favorite KC metro venues to perform?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I regularly play at a locally owned restaurant and second hand shop in Olathe called Simply Reinspired.

Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I live in midtown Kansas City, Missouri (just a few miles north of Westport). My job, however; is on the west side of the state line (in Overland Park, Kansas). I work a typical nine-to-five job so my average day consists of commuting to work at 6:30am, an eight-hour work day, and a garden variety home life (when I’m not performing, teaching, or doing work in the community).</p><br /><br /><p><strong>A few years ago you described your style as ‘blue-collar rap’, a response to ‘industry-saturated propaganda’ of commercial rap and hip-hop. How do you view the current Kansas City hip-hop scene in light of this concerted effort to bring rap and hip-hop back to their roots?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Rap music mined in Kansas City often treks a similar path to the one I alluded to in my biography. Most of the artists I come across and keep company with reflect the daily realities of their lives—as independent artists, parents, and members of the working class. Artists in this town tend to paint realistic images of their lives whether they tend toward the so-called conscious or “street-wise” ends of the spectrum.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1821178994/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://reach.bandcamp.com/album/pen-pusha-mixtape"">Pen Pusha Mixtape by Reach</a></iframe><iframe style=""border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1835646111/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://dominiquesanders.bandcamp.com/album/a-true-story-based-on"">A True Story Based On... by Dominique Sanders</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You have taught creative writing classes on the poetry of hip-hop lyrics.

I’m convinced it’s also helped me to further establish my voice as a writer.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Describe your musical creative process. What tools do you use? How do you break through creative blocks?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My creative processes vary. Music that captures my ear often serves as an inspirational catalyst. There are other times where I write in silence (without accompaniment). The latter tends to be the exception; the former, the rule.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Who or what inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>A little bit of everything, to be honest. I’m inspired by tragedy, triumph, love, nature, various genres of music, television, film, and the many people I’ve come in contact with in life.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br />      <div ><div ><br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/HbC2iDB67tQ?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/N3gY1kBxRCQ?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />          </div><br /><br />  </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=73639521/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://reach.bandcamp.com/album/perfect-strangers-ep"">Perfect Strangers - EP by The Strangers</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Reach Recommends:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>1​. <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/481365036_12_angry_men"">12 Angry Men</a> (DVD) - 1957<br /><br /><br />	2. <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/342182036_the_bluest_eye"">The Bluest Eye</a> by Toni Morrison (Book)<br /><br /><br />	3. <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1360367036_the_case_for_faith"">The Case for Faith</a> by Lee Strobel (Book)<br /><br /><br />	4. <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/359734036_a_raisin_in_the_sun"">A Raisin in the Sun</a> (DVD) - 1961<br /><br /><br />	5. <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/889473036_kind_of_blue"">Kind of Blue</a> by Miles Davis (CD) - 1959<br /><br /><br />	6. <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1150357036_black_power_mixtape"">Black Power Mixtape</a> (DVD) - 2011<br /><br /><br />	7. <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/275711036_songs_in_the_key_of_life"">Songs in the Key of Life</a> by Stevie Wonder (CD) - 1976<br /><br /><br />	8. <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/575119036_the_outsiders"">The Outsiders</a> (DVD) - 1983 <br /><br /><br />	9. <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/500854036_invisible_man"">Invisible Man</a> by Ralph Ellison (Book) - 1947<br /><br /><br />	10. <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1387097036_to_pimp_a_butterfly"">To Pimp a Butterfly</a> by Kendrick Lamar (CD) - 2015</p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1432836338","1484777464","0","0","Hip-hop - Rap","hip-hop|rap","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/reach","https://www.reverbnation.com/emceereach","Learn more about Reach's music here."

Originally from Overland Park, KS, Ivory is not only a singer-songwriter and composer who plans to release an EP or her original music later this year, she is a respected member of at least two Kansas City-based bands as well as Found a Job, a Talking Heads tribute band. For her Listen Local interview, Ivory reveals how the Pancake Principle relates to songwriting, how she was able to ""record, edit and mix a song while I was en route to Jefferson City on an Amtrak train"" and her generous advice for emerging songwriters.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about yourself. How long have you been a musician and songwriter?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I grew up in Overland Park, KS and I put down my roots across the border in Kansas City, MO after graduating from University of Missouri-Columbia several years ago. I started writing songs in 4th grade after my best friend and I started a band called “The Hot Fudge Sundaes”. The first song I remember writing was a poppy country tune called ""Double Love"" about a girl who finds that she has fallen in love with too many boys at once. Thankfully, my songwriting has matured since then.</p><br /><br /><p>In my early 20s, I went through a pretty traumatic personal experience; the shock and subsequent crisis of faith led me to write a song expressing my frustration and raw anger with a God who I’d felt had abandoned me in a time of need. I recorded the song on my laptop in my parents’ garage and had no real intentions of sharing it with anyone, until I encountered a friend who had gone through a similar experience. Sharing my song allowed us to connect and to begin the healing process. Even though other people’s music had always been a form of emotional catharsis for me, I had never really considered that people could find meaning and worth in my own music and experiences until that moment.</p><br /><br /><p>Now, I use my songs as a platform to unearth some of those uncomfortable human feelings and experiences that are nearly ubiquitous but rarely discussed: power imbalances, social injustices, guilt and betrayal. But not all of my songs are super-serious. I still write sappy love songs about cute boys and sunsets and pizza.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/203488709&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your songwriting process. Who or what inspires you? How do you break through creative blocks?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>A lot of my songs start in my car or in the shower, since these are usually the only places where I’m able to be alone with my thoughts. I use my phone to record every little snippet that pops in my head and save it in an app called Evernote, so I can access it later. More often than not, the melody of a song emerges before the theme and lyrics, because I’m much more methodical about my approach to lyrics. I have a tendency to incorporate fictional elements or real details from other people’s lives into my lyrics; I feel that it allows me the freedom to share my own truths while adding a layer of distance or plausible deniability.</p><br /><br /><p>Now that I’m in my late twenties, I’ve accepted that creative blocks are a part of life and I try to deal with them by embracing The Pancake Principle: When you’re making a delicious plate of fluffy pancakes, the first few pancakes in the batch are usually a little imperfect. It’s not until you get to the 4th or 5th pancake that you start to get the hang of things. But if you don’t make those first few imperfect pancakes, you’ll never find true pancake bliss at the bottom of the batter bowl. Songwriting--or any creative process, really---is the same way. You have to give yourself permission to power through and finish a project, even if you know it’s a hot mess, even if you’re feeling uninspired.</p><br /><br /><p>Every musical train wreck I’ve created has taught me about the songwriting process. Alternatively<strong>, </strong>it’s important and beneficial to have the ability to step back from the creative process and take a break if you’re just running into the same wall over and over again. Some songs that seemed to be irrevocably stalled have blossomed after I abandoned them for a few months and came back later with a fresh perspective.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>On a recent entry on your blog you write: “I just get so hyped and teary-eyed seeing people live up to their potential after they have put their time and effort and money and bloodsweattears into something so important and personal. I love watching people break records, win contests, and finish projects.” What projects are you currently working on?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I've spent a lot of time working on other people's projects, and I'm now starting to find the time and energy to focus on my own. I plan to release an EP of my original songs by the end of this year. It's been a personal goal of mine for a long time and I'm looking forward to finally doing it.</p><br /><br /><p>I’m considering branching out and fronting my own band, but being a solo artist has spoiled me, so I still have some reservations about that.</p><br /><br /><p>I'm in the process of developing another project called Coloratura, a trans-media performance piece that combines visual art and music by converting paint brushes and canvas into a midi controller that can create and manipulate live music. Instead of the art inspiring the music or vice versa, both are created simultaneously. It’s a bold new step for me, as my training in the visual arts is somewhat limited, but I’m excited to explore this new opportunity.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/cwWh7KVIpw8?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/203488654&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You are very active in the Kansas City music scene. Where else have you performed? What do you think is the strongest aspect of the Kansas City scene?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>When I was a kid, my parents used to tell me, ""You can achieve anything you want to, if you set your mind to it"", and I think I misinterpreted that as: ""You can achieve *everything* you want to, if you set your mind to it"". As a result, I have a lot of irons in my proverbial fire.</p><br /><br /><p>I'm in a Talking Heads tribute band called 'Found a Job'. We perform a three hour set that covers the pop classics and b-side gems of the Talking Heads. I'm one of the backup vocalists/dancers and I choreograph the dance moves</p><br /><br /><p>I'm in two other original bands: blues rock band Chris Meck & The Guilty Birds and Anna Cole & The Other Lovers, a funky septet that covers a wide range of musical genres.</p><br /><br /><p>I love collaborating with other musicians so I’ve been a guest vocalist or instrumentalist on at least half a dozen albums or EPs in the past few years. Basically, if someone asks me to lend my talent for a short-term project, I’ll usually say yes, unless I have too much on my plate.</p><br /><br /><p>What I love about the Kansas City music scene is that people are so open to collaboration. I don’t feel a strong sense of competition or rivalry among my fellow musicians. We look out for each other, we support and encourage one another. When I moved back to the Kansas City area after college, I was still a very inexperienced musician. I was so fortunate to find people who were willing to take a chance on me and take me under their wings to nurture and encourage me to reach my potential. I hope to be able to do the same for young emerging artists throughout my life.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Where and how do you record your music? What advice do you have for others who want to do the same?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I’m really fortunate that my boyfriend operates a recording studio and rehearsal space in his loft in the West Bottoms. He’s a great sound engineer and has top-of-the-line equipment, so having access to his space and expertise has helped me tremendously.</p><br /><br /><p>When I’m not using his studio, I use my Macbook Pro and a really user-friendly software program from Propellerhead called Reason, along with the accompanying Balance recording interface. When paired with my 36-key midi keyboard, I have a small but powerful setup that allows me to create decent recordings even when I’m traveling. It’s so portable and compact, I was able to record, edit and mix a song while I was en route to Jefferson City on an Amtrak train. Pretty nifty!</p><br /><br /><p>The best advice I could give to emerging songwriters is two-fold:</p><br /><br /><p>1) Don’t feel intimidated by your lack of experience or lack of access to high-quality equipment. Start small, find something that’s user-friendly, learn the essentials and work your way up.</p><br /><br /><p>2) Utilize your community resources and learn from others. Ask questions of other musicians. Sit in on a recording session. Read internet message boards and user forums to learn about new products and to troubleshoot any problems you may have. If you hear about someone doing something cool, get in touch with them and ask them. Be bold, be audacious, take risks, and most importantly, have fun!</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/wX291NzdyFg?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Camry Recommends:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/402804036_stories_of_your_life_and_others"">Stories of Your Life And Others</a> by Ted Chiang</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Ted Chiang is a brilliant sci-fi author.

Brivik is an accomplished composer of scores for short and feature length films, the collaborative nature of which Brivik describes as simultaneously ""challenging"" and ""a lot of fun."" Enjoy our interview with Gavin, read his film and book recommendations from the <a href=""http://www.jocolibrary.org/"">Johnson County Library catalog</a> and listen to samples of his work.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about yourself. Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Well I currently live in Kansas City and I attend the Conservatory of Music at UMKC. I am majoring in music composition and I want to pursue a path in film/tv composition. I work at the university as a building monitor, as well as a seasonal employee Whole Foods Market in Overland Park.</p><br /><br /><p>I usually wake up around 8am and attend class until 3pm each day. After that if I don’t work as a building monitor, I compose scores for short films and feature length films. I have a lot of film work right now, so I am pretty much working every night either as a composer or as a university employee.</p><br /><br /><p>While it seems like I would have no social life with all the things I am doing, I find time to go to the gym pretty often and hang out with friends on the weekends. I have to relieve the stress of my busy life or I would go crazy.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/269614661&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You describe yourself as “film score composer/producer/song-writer/guitarist.” Which of these is the most fun and/or challenging for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Well recently I have found myself primarily scoring films. This is definitely the most fun and challenging work I have ever had. As the film composer you have such a vital role in the film. The music can make or break dramatic moments and the director relies on you to bring their vision to life. It’s a lot of responsibility to bring the right music to the picture, especially when you have a deadline coming up.</p><br /><br /><p>The challenge is deciding the style of music and when and where to place it. Some directors have very specific ideas for the style and placement, but for others it’s very open ended and a lot of those decisions are up to the composer. While this is extremely challenging, the entire process is a lot of fun. Working as a composer can but a very isolating job but in the film industry it’s very collaborative. I think that’s why I am so attracted to film composition as opposed to concert hall composition.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Describe your creative process. What tools do you use? How do you break through creative blocks?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The director will usually send me rough edits of the film or the final cut. I always have a notebook next to me to take notes through my first viewing because I want to note any initial emotional responses I have to the film. These emotional responses are so important because these are the feelings the audience will have upon first viewing.</p><br /><br /><p>So with those notes, I call up the director and discuss the style of music and placement. Maybe I want to build that scene to heighten a feeling, or maybe I want to do a very subtle texture and let the acting carry the scene. Once the director and I narrow something down, I start working on the music.</p><br /><br /><p>I compose most of my music with a keyboard/guitar and my computer. I run Logic ProX and work with both electronic and orchestral music. I find this software to be user friendly and that helps the process</p><br /><br /><p>If I ever have a writing block, I just go listen to music that inspires me. This is something that works for me and everybody has their own way of working through this. I find the deadline helps me write material, and a lot of film composers think the same thing.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/202945916&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/260687616&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What projects are you currently working on?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I am currently finishing up a short film called “Marcel” about a lonely antique shop owner who is too attached to his antiques to sell them. He gets audited and loses his shop which leads to his insanity.</p><br /><br /><p>In May, I will be starting a short film by a KU film student, and this summer I will be working on three projects: a feature length film called “Into the Limelight,” a miniseries called “Captives” and another short film called “Table for Two.”</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Who or what inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I am always watching new movies in my free time and going to see local musicians perform. Submerging myself in local art and cinema inspires me. I also play the guitar in a band, which I’ve found inspires a lot of compositional material.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Gavin's recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Films:</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/348920036_north_by_northwest"">North by Northwest</a> -- directed by Alfred Hitchock and music by Bernard Herrmann.</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/344973036_the_green_mile"">The Green Mile</a> directed by Frank Darabont and music by Thomas Newman.</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/806773036_there_will_be_blood"">There Will Be Blood</a> directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and music by Johnny Greenwood.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Books:</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/501635036_one_flew_over_the_cuckoos_nest""><em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</em></a> by Ken Kesey</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/951892036_the_lord_of_the_rings""><em>Lord of the Rings</em></a> by J.R.R Tolkien</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/423960036_in_cold_blood""><em>In Cold Blood</em></a> by Truman Capote</p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1431608738","1484777726","0","0","Classical","soundtracks|classical","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/gavin-brivik","https://soundcloud.com/gavin-brivik","Learn more about Gavin's music here."

It's a pleasure to share an interview with the band on Listen Local, along with some book and movie recommendations.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourselves. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I play guitar in the band and I am a studying Chemical Engineering at the University of Kansas and I live in Lawrence. When I am not buried in schoolwork I make sure to find time for music.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Greg:</strong> I play guitar in the band, currently working as a shift supervisor at Starbucks and living in Olathe. I also play guitar for a rapper named Duncan Burnett and bass for a grindcore band called Walter Kronkite when I feel like getting loud and angry with my friends.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Blain: </strong>I play bass in the band. I live in midtown Kansas City and I work full time as a Mutual Fund Rep with DST Systems. I also go to school at MCC.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Mike:</strong> I play drums in the band. I live in Belton, where I have a small recording studio and do a lot of work out of there recording and mixing music for bands(including ours). I also have a day job at a company in Olathe.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/247805643&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/247805627&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Delve a little into your process of songwriting as a band. What may surprise listeners about how the music’s created? What tools do you use?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Chris:</strong> What I find the most surprising about songwriting is that what we write can be largely attributed to happenstance. When writing sometimes your fingers find the right frets at the right time, the drummer finds the right rhythm or the bass the right groove. The product is a collection of songs that have come from happy accidents.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Greg</strong>: I feel like a lot of people would expect to hear that we spend a lot of time planning out the direction and sound of a song, when in reality we mostly just jam on parts we write and feel it out. A lot of times we'll be stuck on a song and months later we'll randomly pick it back up with a different perspective on it. From there the rest normally just comes out of us and the song goes off into an idea totally different than what we initially had.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Blain: </strong>What Chris said. Haha! Really though, he is so right; I'd add that I think people would be surprised how much we disagree about things. We all love each other though and we all want to be challenged to be better so it works out.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Chris and Greg are really good about feeding off of each other and coming up with parts that work together in an interesting way. On some occasions we will be practicing and just randomly break out into a jam that ends up really inspiring us. It's awesome when that happens because it's totally organic and everyone just reacts to what is being played and it's natural. We'll also record song ideas to a phone or to the computer and listen back to them objectively to get an audience perspective.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/152066276&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/152065302&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Your music, described as “instrumental art/math-rock,” seems simultaneously improvised and meticulously composed. How long had you been working on the music for <em>Heavy Light</em> before recording it?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Chris:</strong> The genre title, in my opinion, is somewhat arbitrary. The goal of labeling ourselves that way is so that people who are not familiar with math rock or post rock can get an idea of what we are trying to accomplish. We don't take ourselves too seriously, but we would like to consider our music as a piece or art. We also are instrumental and have been compared to many math rock bands by fans.</p><br /><br /><p>Writing for<em> Heavy Light</em> was a long process. There are guitar riffs that I wrote in 2011 that are used on this EP. As a group we wanted to make sure to evolve from our last release<em> Calm and Clear</em> and not fall short of our own expectations, this took longer than expected but the product made us proud.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Greg</strong>: Writing Heavy Light was a pretty long process considering the length of the EP. In between playing as many shows as we could and practicing for them, song writing was on the back burner for most the time. We had also acquired Blain for writing this EP and adding a member to your group takes a little bit to click on that artistic level. Fortunately, with Blain, that happened very quickly and one of the first songs we ever jammed with him ended up being 'Stratovolcano', the opening song on the EP. Other than that, we had about half of it finished when we started recording and completed writing the other songs while tracking. We were surprised to find that writing that way was actually very efficient and helped us sit back and listen to all the parts to hear what each instrument should play.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Blain:</strong> I had hardly any parts for the songs before recording them so I'd say I mostly improvised my parts on the album with some last minute refinement from Mike during the recording process. On the whole though I think the other dudes were more meticulous but I did put a lot of passion into playing cool stuff on the album.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Mike:</strong> I would say in general our music probably sides more with ""meticulously composed"" than with improvised. But with that said, on Heavy Light we started recording it before we were finished writing it. We wrote nearly half of that record while it was being recorded. We had a lot of pieces and bits of ideas that we experimented with, wrote, and recorded, sometimes all in the same day.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/pJxiWMXhZkY?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What did you learn from the recording of <em>Heavy Light </em>that you’ll take to future projects?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Chris</strong>: I don't think this is specifically from Heavy Light, but I am constantly being reminded we are at our best when we work together. If you are in a band, allow your ideas to be critiqued, modified and adjusted. This is the best way to take a song or idea to the next level. Don't become emotionally attached to only one way of using an idea, chances are the other members will find something that works better or paints a different picture and that's okay.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Greg</strong>: Recording ideas and unfinished songs to be able to sit back and listen to them helped a lot on this record. As we're going in to writing our 3rd EP right now, we've definitely taken advantage of Mike's home studio every chance we get.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Blain</strong>: Spend more time on tone! I managed to get some pretty good sounds out of my bass on the record but Mike definitely worked his magic to make the bass sound great on the album. I could have made things even easier on him if I'd tinkered a little more.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Mike</strong>: We often try to write things that are somewhat challenging for us to play so that we grow as players and don't get bored playing our songs live a thousand times. I think a lesson we learned while working on Heavy Light is to not complicate parts for the sake of technicality, but to keep a focus on the emotion or feeling in the song as a whole.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/WUwWlGVV5Lk?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you the most about the Kansas City music scene?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Chris</strong>: The Kansas City music scene is full of motivated individuals striving to constantly improve the culture. Our experiences gigging around this city have been amazing. There are only great things left to come.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Greg</strong>: The KC music scene rules; everyone is super friendly and supportive. The city is filled with a ton of talented people and has had a long history of music. There's so many different genres and scenes in town that anyone can hear something they'd like.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Blain</strong>: I am mostly inspired by the people. Almost everyone I've met in the scene has been so kind and generous and awesome and it fosters a great sense of community. Everyone looks out for each other and hangs out. I can't speak for any other town but it's great here.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Mike</strong>: In addition to the awesome people here, there's also awesome festivals and showcases for local bands all the time (Middle of the Map is coming up!). Our scene may not be as developed as other scenes around the country, but I love it when I talk to a touring band after a show and they say that they weren't expecting their KC show to be all that great but end up being blown away by how cool our town and our music scene are. It makes me proud to be in KC.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/gFp2jQLy-LY?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Via Luna's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Books:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong>Hyperion Cantos</strong></em> by <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Simmons%2C+Dan%22&search_category=author&t=author"">Dan Simmons</a></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong>Survivor</strong></em> by <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Palahniuk%2C+Chuck%22&search_category=author&t=author"">Chuck Palahniuk</a></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1216985036_a_game_of_thrones"">A Game of Thrones</a></strong></em> by George R.

We are extremely lucky to share an interview with Black about how personal struggles have influenced the songs on <em>Ready Get Set</em>, who Black looks to for inspiration, and why ""Kansas City is bliss.""</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourself. Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Hey, first of all my name is Ivory Black and I’m a singer songwriter living in a small town right outside of Kansas City. Short story, I was actually born as Devin Miclette but I adopted the alias Ivory Black a few years ago when I decided to pursue music under a different name. Now let’s fast forward to recently and talk about how I’m living with my manager Klaartje Van Lue which is where I have been for the last 5 years working on my career. I am typically in Kansas City 5 days a week to practice with my band in the evening and I work in our personal studio during the day and weekends. The rest of my day kind of just happens depending on what’s going on.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/WBJ9QJHih6o?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your creative process with songwriting and recording, especially with the songs on your “Ready Get Set” EP. What songs are you most proud of and why</strong>?</p><br /><br /><p>The process of writing music and recording is a very tedious process, as nearly every serious songwriter will tell you. I go through a lot of ideas and I only use a small percentage of them. The best way that I can describe going through my own music, is like going through a box of receipts for just one specific ticket. I'm very unorganized so that plays a major part in that metaphor.</p><br /><br /><p>Since I don’t have a full band, recording is a bit nonconventional because I have to find all the right people and the right sounding instruments. I basically show studio musicians my ideas on a demo I recorded in my home studio so that they can make it ""come to life"". In the process I've worked with some pretty amazing musicians. Craig Kew plays bass on that entire EP, Micah Burdick threw some more guitar in there for me, and Lester Estelle did what he does best. The drums.</p><br /><br /><p>If I had to choose which songs I’m most proud of I’d have to say, all the songs on that EP. It’s my first ever release of what I’ve done, it’s official, and it makes me feel like I’ve accomplished something.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/210747044&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/210746919&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You’re really open and honest about your background on your website and your EPK. You’re willing to share more about yourself – running away from home at 15, genderbinarism  -- than most people would be. Knowing these things about you I think gives your music an added power. Tell us more about how you’ve used music to heal yourself.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The EPK was the most confidential pieces of myself that I’ve ever had to share. I’m not used to opening up about many things in my life, so that video was like my “once and for all, this is who I am (musically and personally) so take it or leave it” memoir type of video I guess you’d say.</p><br /><br /><p>The part about my running away I thought would've been a very difficult thing to talk about, but of course as one moves on into the world, their perception of themselves and what they’ve gone through changes, so it ended up being a lot easier than I imagined it would be.</p><br /><br /><p>Now to delve a bit into the gender binary thing, I always thought I was kind of different as a kid, and a lot of that self-identity stuff was probably the most difficult thing to express through words. I’m still trying to find myself, just like many others, but I wanted to open up about that part of my life because I wanted to somehow represent people that are trying to become comfortable in their own skin within a world full of boxed identities. It’s nice to have your own way of expressing yourself and I like sharing the fact that the possibility exists and it's 100% okay to own that.</p><br /><br /><p>The healing however, is an ongoing process and my music literally heals me in its own way. Whenever I write a song about my life and express it through my lyrics and melody, it’s usually written on paper fueled by this inner turmoil, and it actually helps me express how I actually feel. My music becomes a tool to express my emotions. It being a “tool” I can physically, spiritually, and mentally fix myself and hopefully inspire others to do the same.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/IMG_7370.jpg"" width=""426"" height=""426"" alt=""Ivory Black"" title=""Ivory Black"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div>    <p><strong>What artists do you look to these days for inspiration? What do you admire most about these artists?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Besides listening to music I grew up with, which always inspires me, and without really favoring any of them, I’ve been listening to a lot of upcoming bands as well. I could name a slew of people I find inspirational. Børns is definitely one of many. I’m also a fan of Foster the People as well. I love how bands are perfectly bringing back that classic sound that I grew up with so long ago. It's nostalgic and I feed on it. However, I personally think one of the most influential bands I’ve heard so far is Diane Coffee. They have a few albums out and the singer is a brilliant artist. Their music has a 70ish almost kind of psychedelic vibe. It’s definitely something to look into. They have a pretty cool back-story too actually if you follow that part of an artist.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/4sfRTVCuUXI?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What are you working on currently? When can Ivory Black fans expect to hear new music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I’m always trying to perfect “my sound”. I use quotations to stress the fact that my sound has always had to redevelop in a way that I myself could be satisfied with it. I’ll be content with a song but then feel the need to write something completely different the next week after. Many musicians will say that if they had a choice, NONE of their songs would be finished. For me, it’s my sound haha. I’m always experimenting. I guess you could say that there’s typically something for everyone though.</p><br /><br /><p>However, I’m always working on new material. Trying to make that breakthrough for myself that I can be proud of once more. Just like this EP was a breakthrough for myself as an official release, you can expect something similar within the next year or so produced as a full album.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/210746696&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What most excites you about music and creativity in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>To me, Kansas City is bliss. Nobody is really in it for the competition. It's never been every one person for themselves. There's a hidden agenda of course and the gimmick is basically be as real as you can be. Which is pretty damn easy considering. Everyone is in it together, promoting each other, and talking about each other’s music in a positive way. I adore that about Kansas City. It takes your mind off of the race everybody thinks music is and really brings back what music is all about, sharing your story and this city is all about that.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Ivory's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>MUSIC:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22B%EF%BF%BDRNS%22&search_category=author&t=author"">Børns</a></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Diane+Coffee%22&search_category=author&t=author"">Diane Coffee</a></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&t=author&search_category=author&q=foster+the+people&commit=Search&searchOpt=catalogue"">Foster the People</a></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>BOOKS:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?t=smart&q=lilian+jackson+braun&commit=Search&searchOpt=catalogue"">All of The Cat Who books</a> by Lillian Jackson Braun</strong>.

Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I do most of my composition at my apartment in the West Plaza area of Kansas City, MO. It’s crucial to my process to have a few spaces where I can work. Some pieces are composed almost entirely at my kitchen table, which has high top chairs, some are composed at my desk, and still others, like my recent work <em>I Learned a thing or two, </em>are composed on the couch. When I get blocked, I generally switch spaces until something clicks. There’s no real method, it’s just intuitive.</p><br /><br /><p>There’s really no typical day for me, either. Some days, good music starts to happen at 9 am and doesn’t stop until 20+ hours later. Other days, I focus on freelance score editing, administrative tasks, and email. It’s important to have a place to fall back to if the music isn’t coming, otherwise bad music comes out and corrupts the direction of the piece I’m writing. I’ve learned not to force it.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/229282703&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Delve a little into your own process of composing. What may surprise a listener of your music about how you create it? What tools do you use?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I generally start by hunting for interesting sounds, many of which are specific to the instrument(s) I’m working with. In a recent blog post, I talked about being inspired by the “edge” of the instrument, the place where the music relies on sounds that stretch the instrument as far as it will go. Finding those extreme sounds gives a kind of power to the less aggressive material that I often follow up with. As a result, a lot of my music unfolds as a process of me stripping away details from complex gestures to create much simpler music.</p><br /><br /><p>I also draw from my own experiences as a performer. It may come as a surprise that I was the front man for a heavy metal band in high school. The process of creating songs for my band, which generally consisted of slapping riffs, beats, and vocals together until something worked, continues to have a huge influence on me today. We had no idea what we were doing, and there’s a certain beauty in that.</p><br /><br /><p>I work with pencil and paper for a lot of the process of composing a new piece, but I use Finale notation software to produce my scores and to test out complex ideas that are difficult to realize mentally and/or can’t be duplicated on a keyboard.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/197530690&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Can you point to one time in your life where you knew you wanted to be a composer? Who inspired you early on to create new music and what were your earliest compositions like?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My earliest compositions were short pieces for piano that I wrote when I was about ten or eleven years old. The funny thing is, some of the hallmarks of the music I write now show up in those pieces, particularly in regards to rhythm. I have an irregular heartbeat, and because of that, much of my music doesn’t fall neatly into regular beats.  A couple of years ago, I found a loose sheet of paper tucked away in the music drawer at my parent’s house where, in hilariously bad handwriting, I had struggled to fit a melody into a regular meter, and eventually abandoned the attempt, choosing to write out the rhythm without indicating beats or barlines. This still happens all the time, but I’ve come up more eloquent solutions to the problem.</p><br /><br /><p>I can’t point to a moment when I wanted to be a composer. I quit formally studying music all together for most of high school, only resuming piano lessons late my junior year. I wrote a few pieces that year, decided I liked doing it, and started composing rapidly to get a portfolio together for colleges. It was really a pretty rash decision, but one I’ve never regretted.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/215942100&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>As a member of Kansas City’s FuseBox Collective, you actively advocate for new composers and performers. Talk about the challenges you see with building audiences for new music in Kansas City.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Building an audience for this kind of music is hard for a lot of reasons, but particularly because of the attitude of superiority that tends to surround it. It’s no secret that composers have largely retreated into academia over the course of the last century, and we’ve often been accused of alienating our audience. Compounding the problem, many good-hearted attempts at audience building unintentionally come off as gimmicky or contrived. Making artistic compromises often seems like a way to make an experience more relatable, but it often leaves a casual listener feeling patronized and the aficionado dissatisfied.</p><br /><br /><p>The path forward, as I see it, is using music as a way to dialogue with a global society hungry for fresh ideas and modes of expression without making any concessions for quality. Millennial composers are plugged in to a vast social media network, and are exposed to a huge variety of competing ideas every day. This wealth of material is begging to be commented on, and I see FuseBox as a way to bring projects that do so to fruition in ways that can’t be easily ignored.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Who or what inspires you now?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>It’s a huge question. First and foremost, I thrive on the encouragement from my wife, Cassie. She’s the one who refused to let me give up music during a very discouraging semester of my Bachelor’s degree, and I’m thriving because of it.</p><br /><br /><p>I have a close group of friends that formed around FuseBox, and they are, in many ways, a source of inspiration. We’re a bit of an odd group -- our music couldn’t be much different, and we all have very different personalities. What fascinates me is that every one of them is going about saying what they want to say in their own way, with their own unique voice. The conversations we have about music, art, culture, and the ways they relate to each other are a great resource when I’m hunting for a new idea for a piece. I try to be open to anything, so there’s no telling what might inspire my next piece.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Zane's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1094466036_a_portrait_of_the_artist_as_a_young_man""><strong><em>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em></strong></a> by James Joyce</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/762496036_the_rest_is_noise""><strong><em>The Rest Is Noise</em></strong></a> by Alex Ross (strongest recommendation)</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/355618036_fantasia_2000""><strong><em>Fantasia 2000</em></strong></a></p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/995605036_notes_on_light"">Notes on Light</a>,</em></strong> music of Kaija Saariaho</p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/221428036_petrushka"">Petrushka</a> </em></strong>by<strong><em> </em></strong>Igor Stravinsky</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/423435036_howl_and_other_poems""><em>Howl and Other Poems</em></a> </strong>by Allen Ginsberg</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/630131036_the_satanic_verses""><strong><em>The Satanic Verses</em></strong></a> by Salman Rushdie</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1447091653","1485194388","0","0","Electronic|Classical|Experimental","classical|experimental","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/zane-winter","http://www.zanewinter.com/","Learn more about Zane's music here."

That’s when I first heard about UMKC, and I was thinking maybe I could come to UMKC to pursue the higher degrees of composition-master’s and doctoral. Dr. Chen told me that I had to be very competent of my compositions if I want to come here, so after that, I worked very hard on composition knowledge, skills, and composed pieces with both quality and quantity.

Composition Competition. What is involved with this honor?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The Celebrate Asia! Composition Competition is sponsored by Seattle Symphony. Its program featuring a themed celebration of the Pacific Northwest’s Asian communities with a special emphasis on Korean and Chinese music and culture. The composition competition requires a short orchestral piece related to or inspired by Asian culture, or anything about Asia. There is no limitation to the composer candidate, only the music must be related to or inspired by Asian culture.</p><br /><br /><p>My orchestra piece <em>Bai Chuan Fu Hai</em>, named by my wife, literally “hundreds of rivers go into the ocean”, and it is inspired by the ancient philosopher Zhu xi, who said, “hundreds of rivers go into the ocean, but the ocean does not overflow”, according to chapter two of his book Zhu Zi’s Words. At the beginning of the music, I use multiple themes and instruments to refer to the bitty streams and little tributaries; with free micro-counterpoint to depict the process of the streams flowing; using rapidly crescendo to describe the little streams finally converge to rivers with monstrous waves and loud noises. At the end of the piece, the music diminuendo after the surging theme which symbolizes the peaceful and vast sight of the ocean surface, echoes the sentence “the ocean does not overflow”.</p><br /><br /><p>Seattle Symphony will perform the piece in Celebrate Asia! Concert on the thirty-first day of January, 2016.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/1349093998%20%281%29.png"" width=""888"" height=""803"" alt=""Shao Zheng"" title=""Shao Zheng"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div>    <p><strong>Delve a little into your own process of composing. What may surprise a listener of your music about how you create it? What tools do you use?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>This is a very difficult question for me to answer. In a word, I have a strong will to compose music with both intense Chinese culture influences and my own unique personality. To achieve this goal is extremely difficult! The traditional Asian music is very well-known for its emphasis on the subtlety of melodic variations, this is quite true, but the harmony in the melodic scale may be hugely different by nations. For example, Chinese traditional music scales have an atmosphere of happiness, harmonious, cheerful mood, but on the other side, the Japanese music scales have feelings of mysterious, meditative, and even a little sorrowful and somewhat sad mood which is hard to talk about.</p><br /><br /><p>As for me, the melody writing is my main emphasis of my composition, with some modern techniques I use, and some of my compositions are highly polyphonic and virtuosic. I am also a skilled pianist, so I also composed a lot of piano music for both solo piano and piano concerto with orchestra with a stunning virtuosic fingers technique.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/227705819&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>When did you realize you first wanted to be a composer? What were your earliest compositions like? </strong></p><br /><br /><p>I start learning piano when I was very young, about 4 years old, so my first compositions are all improvised on the piano without written down. I remember when I was in high school, I improvised lots of piano music on the piano-maybe more than 100 pieces. During that time, I was thinking I can be a professional composer, not only a pianist, so I choose composition major after high school. Until now, I have composed many music in every genres, for chamber ensemble, orchestral, instrumental and voice.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/90357550&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How has living in Kansas City (or America for that matter) influenced your work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I like Kansas City so much, not only because its beautiful landscape, the weather, the architectures, but also the people living there who are very nice and easy-going.

I also like to fashion shadow puppets out of trash and perform short plays.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/6HodogjfL9A?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/140995958"" width=""500"" height=""281"" frameborder=""0"" webkitallowfullscreen="""" mozallowfullscreen="""" allowfullscreen=""""></iframe> <p><a href=""https://vimeo.com/140995958"">Mikal Shapiro - Out On The Town ( Official Video)</a> from <a href=""https://vimeo.com/capture3"">Capture3</a> on <a href=""https://vimeo.com"">Vimeo</a>.</p>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Can you point to one time in your life where you knew you wanted to be a songwriter? Who or what inspired you early on to create music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I've been making up songs since I was a kid. I came from a musical family so there was always a piano in the house and cheesy movie scores to inspire me. My father had a collection of musical soundtracks as well. For my 5th grade talent show, I lip-synced and danced to Macavity from the Broadway production of <em>Cats</em>--I think that was a breakout moment for me. I also listened to <em>Les Miserables</em> thousands of times during an era of pre-teen angst. Though I've been slow to admit it, musicals have had a big impact of my songwriting. My most recent album, <em>The Musical</em>, is a nod to those early influences. When I was 18, my bff and fellow songwriter Kasey Rausch lent me a guitar and I began writing and composing songs. At the time, I was into grunge and psychedelic rock, some skater punk stuff, funk and metal. These days, I'm a big folky. You could say my musical tastes have run the gamut. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2160822540/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=57694501/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://mikalshapiro.bandcamp.com/album/the-musical-2015"">The Musical (2015) by Mikal Shapiro</a></iframe><iframe style=""border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2160822540/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=3296948842/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://mikalshapiro.bandcamp.com/album/the-musical-2015"">The Musical (2015) by Mikal Shapiro</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You are an outspoken advocate for Kansas City music, whether it’s hosting <em>River Trade Radio</em> (with Kasey Rausch), developing the <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1401121036_greater_kansas_city_music_directory"">Greater Kansas City Music Directory</a>, or performing solo or in any number of collaborations with fellow musicians.

What got you through?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grew up so I initially went to art school from 2000-2002. That's where I hit rock bottom artistically. What I thought would be fertile ground for exploration was in truth a stifling and expensive downer. But it was also a blessing in disguise. I learned how to navigate my fears of failure and need for acceptance. I dropped out and began an incredibly fruitful creative journey of music, art, writing and filmmaking. Although I experience an artistic slump from time to time, I have the wisdom (now in my old age, ha!) to recognize it as the calm before the storm. In short, I learned that frustration is an incredible motivator to slip out of the stagnant known and into the impossible where the juicy stuff resides.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2160822540/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=1504046440/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://mikalshapiro.bandcamp.com/album/the-musical-2015"">The Musical (2015) by Mikal Shapiro</a></iframe><iframe style=""border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2160822540/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=273342424/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://mikalshapiro.bandcamp.com/album/the-musical-2015"">The Musical (2015) by Mikal Shapiro</a></iframe><iframe style=""border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2160822540/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=354313352/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://mikalshapiro.bandcamp.com/album/the-musical-2015"">The Musical (2015) by Mikal Shapiro</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What are you looking forward to in the coming year?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I am looking forward to making more music and art with my friends and loved ones this coming year.

Where do you reside? How long have you been a musician and songwriter?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I came to Kansas City from Grand Rapids, Michigan in 2009 to study Clarinet Performance and Music Composition at the University Of Missouri Kansas City. I have been here in Kansas City going on 6 years now. I picked up the guitar and started writing tunes at 16. I put my songwriting on hold for many many years to pursue a degree in clarinet performance. It wasn’t until I graduated from college that I picked my songwriting back up combining all the elements that I learned in school to approach songwriting in a whole new light.</p><br /><br /><p>I picked up the Banjo a little over a year ago and that has changed my life. I don’t know why but I felt the banjo calling for me. That deep old fashioned sound was intriguing to me and opened up a whole new world for songwriting.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/175045789&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/174753168&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your songwriting process. Who or what inspires you? How do you break through creative blocks?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My songwriting process begins in my bed with a cup of coffee. I can’t really pinpoint where I get inspiration for the songs I write. It starts with me muddling around on the banjo. Just playing, jamming with no purpose in mind. It starts with a discovery process. What new sounds can I come up with? What chord inversions should I explore? Oh, this sounds nice! Now where do I go from there? What would compliment this nice thing I just did? The process starts with me getting to know my banjo deeper.</p><br /><br /><p>From there, I start to think of words. They just come after a while. I have notebooks filled and scribbled with lyrics. When it comes to what I want to write about, it depends on so many factors. What am I feeling? How does what I am playing make me feel? Did something external inspire me or is what I am writing purely internal emotion?</p><br /><br /><p>Sometimes I try to break through creative blocks by learning old Appalachian tunes. The cool thing about the banjo is there are so many different tunings to play with! I have books filled with old traditionals and I will go through and learn a new tuning and song.  For example, I learned an old murder ballad called Pretty Polly and continued to mess around in the tuning and came up with my own tune called Ain’t Goin’ North.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/q2Qfi3S4vGc?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>On <a href=""http://www.teriquinn.com"">your website</a> </strong><strong>you describe yourself as mixing “an old fashioned sound with a modern luster.” However, you have also written experimental music for the Black House Collective. How does one style of your music inform another?  </strong></p><br /><br /><p>First I should give some back-story. I am a sponge and have always been involved with multiple styles of music. During college, by day I was a classical musician. At night, when I was done studying and practicing, I would fill my time discovering new indie bands. When I had a moment to spare, I would put down my clarinet and pick up my guitar (which was rare.) In high school, I was playing in youth symphonies as well as jamming in ska/punk bands. I never pigeonholed myself. I never will pigeonhole myself.</p><br /><br /><p>Going to school for music composition allowed me to learn the tools on how to combine all of these styles together. Whether writing a chamber work or orchestrating for an indie rock band. I am able to add classical influence into my indie rock writing and I am able to combine indie rock into my classical writing.</p><br /><br /><p>Which brings me to Black House Collective. When I wrote for Black House, I grabbed from all areas. It would start with a rhythmic and melodic idea inspired by whatever band I was into at the time. My compositions are very rhythmically and melodically driven.</p><br /><br /><p>My compositional approach is very similar to my songwriting approach. It all starts with sitting down and discovering sounds and melodies. Its fun to come up with a little ditty and wonder where it’s going to go next. When the piece is finished, its fun to look back at the little ditty I came up with and wonder, how did this little thing germinate into this completed piece?</p><br /><br /><p>I am now primarily a Banjo player. I’ve only been playing for a little over a year but it has taken over my life and I am grateful for it. It has been a wonderful experience learning to play and discover new sounds and write new tunes with. I mostly play traditional clawhammer style but I don’t write traditional sounding tunes. I mean, kind of. Its going to sound old fashioned because the banjo just has that sound. But my approach is not to have traditional Appalachian sounding music. I guess that’s what I mean by ‘Old fashioned sound with a modern luster.’</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/164240993&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/85469155&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Tell us about some of the other projects you’re involved with.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I am in a few other bands. I have been playing clarinet and guitar in <a href=""http://claireandthecrowdedstage.com/"">Claire and The Crowded Stage</a> for about 3 years (maybe 4? Maybe less? I can’t remember.) It is an 7 piece indie rock group that is lead by a wonderful Kansas City based singer-songwriter Claire Adams. The musicians in this group are crazy good. We just come together to work on Claire’s tunes and brainstorm orchestration ideas to make her tunes sound…well….amazing. We don’t play many shows because all the musicians in this group are involved in a million other bands. But when we do play shows, its super fun!</p><br /><br /><p>I am lead singer and guitarist for another band called <a href=""http://www.roomswithoutwindows.bandcamp.com"">Rooms Without Windows</a>. They’ve been a band for a little while but I joined as lead singer in September. We have only had a few shows with the new band line up and are working on booking more. We are a dance-pop meets dream-punk sort of band. The musicians in this band are also amazing. I am really lucky to be involved in different groups that keep me sharp and continue to up my standards in musicianship.</p><br /><br /><p>The cool thing about being involved in different groups as well as working on my own solo projects is I get to put on a different face in each group. I get to be someone else for a second while on stage. It’s a lot like acting. I am a performer and I love to perform!</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/PT2XX9HmRC0?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Where do you perform?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I perform all sorts of places.

What advice do you have for others who want to do the same?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The recordings you hear on my website were done by Brent Jamison. He is a great friend and a wonderful engineer. It’s hard to give advice because I’m still trying to figure this out still.</p><br /><br /><p>My advice is to constantly plan ahead, network, and make friends with people who have decent recording equipment in their bedrooms to make tiny EPs until you can afford to go to a studio. Studios are expensive and they deserve all the money that they charge.</p><br /><br /><p>Being a successful songwriter means you have to be an entrepreneur. It’s a business and you have to constantly be thinking outside the box. Its not just songwriting: it’s marketing, designing, booking, wining and dining, budgeting, etc. Everyone and their mother is a songwriter so you have to come up with ways that set you apart. I’m still trying to figure out what that means. ;)</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Teri's recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/841660036_the_fall"">The Fall </a>directed by Tarsem Singh.

What are you looking forward to in 2016?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The biggest lesson I have learned in 2015 is to keep going and follow through. I have learned to be relentless. Sometimes I have no idea what I am doing with my life or with my art. I break down about it at least every other day. But I have learned that I have to do something everyday that will continue to propel me in a direction; even if I don't know which way the compass is pointing. Sitting still is dangerous. I haven't watched Netflix in months. There is no time and I have no desire. </p><br /><br /><p>I am looking forward to my first EP release! Keep up with me on Facebook and Twitter to find out when it will be! I am also looking forward to the possibility of touring. My dreams are coming together and I believe 2016 will be an incredible year. I have been working so hard through 2015 that I am finally starting to see my goals coming to fruition on the horizon. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/PT2XX9HmRC0?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p>Teri recommends <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/841475036_the_war_of_art"">The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win your Inner Creative Battles</a> by Steven Pressfield. </p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1446659653","1484769628","0","0","Folk - Americana","folk|banjo","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/teri-quinn-0","http://www.teriquinn.com/","Learn more about Teri Quinn here."

For his Listen Local feature, Elliot gives some insight into this ambitious project and shares a preview of the next chapter in this series, ""Can U Hear Me?"".</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about your first single “Is Anybody Out There?” What inspired it?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The song was brought on by an existential, quarter-life crisis. Growing up I had a very idealistic, sort of Disney Channel view of what life should look like. Suddenly I was thrown out into the world and realized that nothing so far had turned out the way I had imagined. For most people that realization would have come sooner, but for me it was sudden and earth-shattering. Everything was upside down, backwards, and inside-out. That feeling of confusion and increasing isolation was really starting to drive me out of my mind at a very rapid pace. I had to do something; it was truly about survival at that point. I wrote ""Is Anybody Out There?"" in a basement I didn't belong in on a piano that wasn't mine. I turned off all the lights and the song lit up the room.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/12144051_889223534500748_1736434537_n_0.jpg"" width=""480"" height=""480"" alt=""Y the Ghost"" title=""Y the Ghost"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/197481197&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How and where did you record it?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Using an old Roland XP-50, I started to turn the song into something more upbeat and abstract. I recorded a blueprint demo of a pop song myself, which I then took to Bret Liber at Red Roof Productions who helped me amp it up into this airy atmospheric roller-coaster ride that was polished but messy in all the right ways. I wanted the song to feel like being drunk and sad at 2am with the sound of the city buzzing around you, and he helped me make it happen. It was the first time in my life that my idealistic visions had truly materialized exactly how I imagined them, and I knew I was on to something.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/11849816_1137652076262318_625640928_n.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""640"" alt=""Y the Ghost"" title=""Y the Ghost"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/hWCfq-2YAn0?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Even at this early stage in your career, so much of your sound and image seem well thought-out. In fact, you describe “Is Anybody out There” as the “first chapter” in a larger project. How far out have you planned this project?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I am at a VERY early, infantile stage and the larger project is essentially my life. Each track, each video is its own chapter that captures, in a larger-than-life/theatrical way, where I'm at in that current moment. The story is unfolding naturally and organically and each project is the light in the darkness helping me get from point A to point B. I have probably 2 albums worth of ideas sort of guiding where I wanna go next, but for now I'm taking it chapter by chapter until I eventually have enough resources to tackle all the material in bigger chunks. IAOT was my way of making my presence known, to hopefully speed things up as much as possible.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/149309513&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What artists and/or eras do you look to for inspiration?

His best films are centered around something out-of-this-world extraordinary happening to a small person that is flawed and relatable, and I'm just amazed at how magically he captures that. I'm obviously not a giant Hollywood blockbuster machine, but I want my work to capture those feelings of wonder + intimacy.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br />      <div ><div ><br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/T5Jbqj-YD1w?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/hw4lne8Oz_Q?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />          </div><br /><br />  </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What most excites you about music and creativity in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>There's so many ideas and sounds that haven't been explored yet, or at least not enough in my opinion.

How close are you coming to creating “the most soulfully orchestrated indie pop masterpiece mankind has ever witnessed”?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>TPOV was created with a solo project mentality. I wrote, recorded, and produced it in my basement with the help of a little production knowledge I acquired in the preceding year. Limited by my resources at the time, TPOV turned out leaning more in a synth pop direction than I usually prefer when I'm writing music. The live band made up of Justin Walker (bassist), Austin Edmisten (drums), Jesse Bartmess (synth), and Matt Kosinski (lead guitar) was introduced after I released TPOV with the purpose of playing shows. However, when we started writing songs together our distinctive styles as varying musicians evolved our initial genre into a sort of nostalgic modern-day interpretation of 50's-60's doowop/surfpop music. Degenerate Matters is kind of swimming between the worlds of organic and electronic sounds, but the lyrical theme contrasts the somberness of my solo writing in TPOV with a matured, sarcastic and somewhat playfully disdainful approach.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/219296136&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What have you learned from your recent recording experiences that you'll take to future ones?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Degenerate Matters has been recorded/mixed/mastered at Element Recording with Joel Nanos. Joel is a distinguished and highly regarded engineer/producer in the KC music scene, because his production work on records is not only unique, but memorable. While my brain overloads in an attempt to retain mental notes on his various production methods, I've benefitted most from observing how he organizes/anticipates the recording process so that it flows smoothly into the mixing/mastering stages. He goes by the principle of ""It's the notes that you don't play"", which is the idea of creating space and focus in an arrangement, so that when you enter the mixing stage, the end product can sound cool without needing to layer on/work around too many varying instrument parts in an attempt to sound complex.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/uUtCqzKBRpY?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Can you point to one time in your life where you knew you wanted to be a songwriter? Who or what inspired you early on to create music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I can't pinpoint one exact epiphany-like moment where I knew I wanted to be a songwriter, but I imagine it was probably somewhere around the time when 11-year-old Rachel with headphones and a disc-man sang and danced around her bedroom listening to her older brother's CDs. I got my first guitar at 8 years old, and while that's my main songwriting tool - I know that I probably wouldn't have ended up singing at all unless I felt a connection to the words that were in the songs I was singing along to. I never paid as much attention to the vocal quality of a singer, as much as I listened to and had an appreciation for the meaning/feeling they were conveying with their lyrics.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/photo.jpg"" width=""900"" height=""900"" alt=""Rachel Mallin"" title=""Rachel Mallin"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/ULEWYqmimEs?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What excites you the most about the Kansas City-area music scene?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The people.

It's an honor getting to be a part of it, because I learn so much from other bands who have been prevalent in the scene for sometime, all while getting to learn and discover new music that makes its way on to the scene. While I can't predict if KC will be the next Austin, I know there's been a surge in the growth and recognition of our city's music scene in the last 5 years and I'm very excited to see how it develops in years to come.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Rachel's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Books:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1092663036_5_very_good_reasons_to_punch_a_dolphin_in_the_mouth"">5 Very Good Reasons To Punch A Dolphin In The Mouth</a></em></strong> by Matthew Inman</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1344905036_the_mixing_engineers_handbook"">The Mixing Engineer's Handbook</a></strong></em> by Bobby Owsinki</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/320001036_brave_new_world"">Brave New World</a></strong> by Aldous Huxley</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Films:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1294365036_twenty_feet_from_stardomdvd"">20 Feet From Stardom</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1316619036_her"">Her</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/416147036_the_graduate"">The Graduate</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Albums:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Con Law</strong> by Generationals</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1035975036_the_suburbs"">The Suburbs</a></strong></em> by Arcade Fire</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong>Wildewoman</strong></em> by Lucius</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1358042036_seeds"">Seeds</a></strong></em> by TV on the Radio</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/Rachel-Mallin-and-the-Wild-Type-1024x683.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""683"" alt=""Rachel Mallin and the Wild Type"" title=""Rachel Mallin and the Wild Type"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div></div>","","437","1","1462380853","1485190492","0","0","Rock|Pop|Alternative","rock|pop","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/rachel-mallin-wild-type","http://rachelmallin.com/","Learn more about Rachel Mallin &amp; the Wild Type here"

Formed in 2010 by main vocalist and lyricist Marty Hillard, Ebony Tusks evolved to become a potent and cerebral hardcore trio with the addition to Nathan Giesecke (Geese) and Daniel Smith. We caught up with the band ahead of their <a href=""http://www.middleofthemapfest.com/"">Middle of the Map </a>showcase next week with a new interview and some generous movie, book and music recommendations.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourselves. Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Daniel:</strong> My name is Daniel, I live in Lawrence and I work at a local non-profit which provides after school job-training programs for under-served youth. I normally wake up at 8:00am, work 9-5, and then play computer games while drinking beer.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Geese:</strong> My name is Nathan Giesecke, but everyone just calls me Geese. I grew up in Olathe but now live and work in Kansas City, MO. On a typical day I go to work, come home and play video games with my roommates or make beats in my bedroom.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Marty:</strong> My name is Marty Hillard. I am the main vocalist/lyricist (I rap under the moniker Bodye, pronounced ""body"") and I also produce beats, as do my bandmates Geese and Daniel.</p><br /><br /><p>I live in and work in the Old Town neighborhood in downtown Topeka with my fiancee and one-year-old daughter. I'm up by 7 am so I can get my daughter to day care on time before work. I work in customer accounting for a natural gas utility. I come home, have dinner, play with my daughter, put her to bed, do a chore or two, then try to squeeze in something creative before bed.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/13979405&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Tell us about the origins of Ebony Tusks. How has this band evolved? What are you most proud of so far?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Daniel: </strong>The group has just sort of naturally snowballed from being a solo project for Marty, to being a full fledged performing duo, to being what it is now: a trio working collaboratively. I'm really proud that we always approach finances as a stepping stone rather than an goal. Money is something that enables us to make music rather than music being something that enables us to make money.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Geese: </strong>Ebony Tusks started as Marty doing a rap project while being in another band that was very active, and then involved Dan and I onstage, and then became the three of us behind the scenes and on the stage. I’m really proud that I didn’t know either of these guys before we were in a band together and now we all like each other a lot and get along famously.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Marty: </strong>It was a project I started with other producers back in 2010. I asked Daniel to DJ for me sometime in 2011-2012 (?) and Geese joined not too far behind him. Daniel and I had become fast friends when I lived in Lawrence and he was the nicest, most easygoing DJ of the handful I knew. He made our shows a lot less stressful. Geese was and is a lighting technician for a number of our friends' projects and that was how I made acquaintance with him, seeing him work for a band and asking if he'd do lights for an EBONY TUSKS concert. He eventually asked if he could be hypeman for us and he brought an intensity that we didn't have prior.</p><br /><br /><p>We've evolved in that we all contribute to music production. I also think that, starting in 2013, we began to carve out a style of performance that best reflects our musical taste and our collective personality. It's gotten more aggressive, more impassioned, more emotional, which was perhaps a reaction to seeing so many insular, repellent rap shows up to that point.</p><br /><br /><p>We've had the fortune of opening up for some heroes, Shabazz Palaces, Talib Kweli, Vince Staples, clipping. I'm most proud of our ability to still find a way to leave an impact on their crowds standing next to those pillars. We are really in pursuit of inserting ourselves into the dialogue by being our unique selves.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/202631615&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your creative process with songwriting and recording, especially in terms of collaborations within and outside of the band. What tools do you use? What may surprise people about how your music is created?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Daniel: </strong>Most people assume that I make all of the tracks because I'm the guy who stands behind the DJ stuff but historically Marty has produced most of the tracks. Going forward all three of us are producing and any future work we put out will probably be split fairly evenly amongst us. People might also be surprised to find out that we usually all work separately, and that we all live in different cities. Much of our collaboration comes from sharing tracks online and giving each other feedback.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Geese: </strong>All three of us make music independently, so it only made sense for all of us to start putting our heads together. Currently we have beats that we’ve made as individuals and submitted for feedback and adjusted in addition to more collaborative efforts. We’ve got some Dropbox folders right now with samples going back and forth all the time.</p><br /><br /><p>My toolset is Ableton Live with Ableton Push, everything I make comes through Ableton. I also enjoy utilizing analog effects and noisemakers on occasion. I currently have a drawer in my bedroom full of weird kid’s toys that I will circuit bend and sample into Ableton. We’ve got two tracks in the works right now that include samples from circuit bent components that I’ve made.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Marty: </strong>I personally use a Yamaha 16-track, an Ibanez Artcore semi-hollowbody electric guitar, a Squire bass guitar, and lots of Roland keyboards and drum machines. Fairly rudimentary compared to what's available. I personally like the constraints and I'm used to the workflow. Outside of editing no one I know seems to be able to tell the difference. We've given input to one another on tracks and are experimenting with actually collaborating on stuff. It's still pretty new to us.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/59799593&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What artists do you look to these days for inspiration? What do you admire most about these artists?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Daniel: </strong>My biggest influences are always whatever I'm listening to most recently. Lately I've been listening to Garden of Delete by Oneohtrix Point Never a lot. Over the past two months I've probably listened to the Hamilton soundtrack every day at least a little bit. The final David Bowie album is also legitimately great. I admire courage in music more than anything else. It takes courage to make music that is unexpected or ugly.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Geese: </strong>My biggest inspirations are Daft Punk, Kanye West and Jack White. Daft Punk because of their influence and aesthetic. I am passionate about lighting design and live stage production and I think Alive 2007 is the greatest stage production of all time. I love Kanye because I don’t think anyone else on the planet Earth could make Kanye West music. He’s incredibly unique and that’s my favorite thing about him. Yeezy 2020. Jack White is my favorite musician full stop. The White Stripes really resonated with me when I was young and I’ve been hooked ever since. I drove to Nashville last year to visit Third Man Records for Record Store Day.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Marty: </strong>I'm still fairly inspired by many of the artists that I was when EBONY TUSKS started, Chuck Inglish, HEALTH, These New Puritans. I'd say over the years that list has come to include producers like the Haxan Cloak, Andy Stott, Lotic, and Arca. I also like instrumental bands like This Will Destroy You and Blue Sky Black Death. I spend a lot of time thinking about drones, fragments of sounds, minimalism, negative space, elements that our music doesn't have much of now but will as time goes on. I'd definitely be remiss in not sharing acts we feel a kinship with like clipping., Cities Aviv, Death Grips, B L A C K I E, Young Fathers, artists with whom we've been working in a similar space. Sometimes musicians shy away from referencing acts they may be accused of sounding like but we're not worried about that. If we do or don't belong it doesn't matter, we'll still be EBONY TUSKS.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/hfAwjFY2KNM?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What are you most looking forward to in 2016?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Daniel: </strong>I'm really hoping they finally announce a new Pokémon game.

Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Joe Stanziola. I live and work in Kansas City currently. I've been pushing this Doo Wop Rap thing for about 5 years as of this point. It's really just a fancy way of saying I like to make music that's my own. Someone from Atlantic Records when I first started out told me to pick a genre so that's what I did. I think he meant, pick Rap or Alternative or something but that's besides the point.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/237781538&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/220709042&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Your latest album, Almost Blue, has been receiving very positive reviews. Talk about the recording of this album. What were the biggest challenges for you? What did you learn that you'll take to future projects?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Thank you for that. Almost Blue is really the B-Sides to Before the Bomb Drops. I had songs like Tokyo, that I just wasn't sure how to fit on Before the Bomb Drops so within 6 months of each other I dropped them. I like to consider Almost Blue a small story within the world of Before the Bomb Drops. It's the story of a jazz singer who realizes his dreams aren't his purpose. Among his story are other stories that denounce things in this world that deal with depression, angst, anger, money, and other topics. I will admit this probably would of never been a full project had I not lost a friend to depression.</p><br /><br /><p>I'd say the biggest challenge from creating this record was deciding whether to release it or not. I sent it to a peer group before I released it to see what I had and what I got back was pretty positive. I decided to run with it and the response like you said has been great.</p><br /><br /><p>I've sort of accidentally turned into a concept based writer. I didn't mean to but I guess I just enjoy writing tracks that way. I can vent through the characters, and Almost Blue I think I pieced together a story a little better.

Who do you see as your musical peers? Who really inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I started the Doo Wop Rap thing not as a gimmick but more as a Doo-Wop awareness. I'm a huge fan of Doo Wop music and when I first started out I used to call managers of The Drifters, The Coasters, The Cadillacs, and others asking for advice and how to approach this thing. As far as peers go, that's a tough one. I've kind of been focused on doing my own thing. I'd like to think someday my peers will be those oldies guys, or this new wave of retro artists but who knows. I'd like to someday have a whole fleet of Doo Wop rappers, even if they don't create Doo Wop music or music in my style but just a group of people who get it. I'm working to create my peers I guess.</p><br /><br /><p>I'm really inspired right now by failing a lot. I've kept all those demons pretty close. I'm really inspired by Gil Scott-Heron currently, Miles Davis, I'm listening to ANOHNI currently, there are certain cuts on this new Kanye record that really get me. Kendrick Lamar is incredible. Natalie Prass, Ceschi, STEDDY P, the way Mac Lethal has been creating is awesome. The scene in Synecdoche, New York with the preacher talking about how angry he is. The Jumpman Derek Jeter commercial I watch a lot.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/F9rD2RXH1RM?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Delve a little into your own process of songwriting. What may surprise a listener about how you create your music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I really enjoy isolation when I make new music. I'm not sure how surprising that is, but it's how I do it. I also, at times, have directed my personal life to figure out something I was writing. That might just be an excuse to do something but who knows. I released the B-Sides of Before the Bomb Drops and probably have a full length C-Sides if I ever decide to release them which I probably won't. Sometimes I'll write a song and choose not to record it because I enjoy the writing too much. I have one song in particular that I'll never record but I think it's awesome. I've never recorded anywhere other than my bedroom.</p><br /><br /><p>I prefer subjects I can relate to which is why the concepts come. CHUCK, Before the Bomb Drops, Almost Blue, this project I have coming in 2017. They are all things I personally relate to in someone else or would rather say in another way of saying it. If I make a concept record it gives me an excuse to get extra personal which doesn't make any sense. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/iP9y2GkwEvc?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you the most about the Kansas City music scene?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The most inspiring thing I've gotten from Kansas City is the love. That might seem like a cliche answer but it still blows my mind every time I play the song Cold Shoulder and people are singing along. It's been happening for a year but it still surprises me.</p><br /><br /><p>Kansas City gets the short end of the stick when it comes to touring artists sometimes, and nobody mentions the Kansas City music scene as a place to break out but there are some really good things happening here. For instance, I've started to get some airtime on 96.5 because I told them that's what I wanted and boom. It's right there. I'm really happy that Kansas City isn't putting on airs and it's allowing me to create. I'd love to have more money at shows, and more people but right now I'm in a really sweet spot where I can create ANYTHING I want and nobody can really say anything. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/2bbCFsF7E5o?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Second Hand King's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>1. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/402339036_feel_it_sam_cooke_live_at_the_harlem_square_club,_1963"">Live at Harlem Square Club 1963</a></strong></em> by Sam Cooke.

At the age of three he was playing the piano by ear. By thirteen he found he picked up his first mountain dulcimer and quickly developed his own playing style. His career as a recording and performance artist goes back to 1974 when Folkways/Smithsonian Records signed him to major recording contract. And while he has toured internationally for many years, Roth may be most familiar as the voice of PBS's ""Shining Time Station"" theme song. Covering adult and children's folk, classical and world music, Kevin Roth is a quintessential American artist. Enjoy our interview and his book recommendations.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I'm an innovative dulcimer player, singer songwriter who has many recordings and has been doing this music thing since 1976. I am in the middle of a new album produced by one of my mentors, Noel Paul Stookey of Peter, Paul & Mary which I'm quite excited about. My history and everything else is on my <a href=""http://www.kevinrothmusic.com/"">website</a>.</p><br /><br /><p>Morning coffee then hour walk with my dog in the park. I also try to meditate. Then I look at emails, and work on career either through bookings or songwriting. Evenings I either cook, or go out and watch Youtube or Netflix in the eve. I no longer own a TV. Every Thursday when I'm in town I teach private dulcimer lessons.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/YgCg36z9JtM?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Your performing and recording career is quite extensive. How have you grown as an artist since you first started making music and performing?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I'm faster and better at it. My voice and playing as well as songwriting has improved a lot. I'm much more a songwriter now. Back then I was a folk singer only and dulcimer player. I was also only 16. I'm now 59 (grin) The early recordings are all on Folkways Smithsonian Records. The music business is very, very hard now. People are downloading and that kills merchandise sales at shows. People don’t understand downloading and streaming pay very little to the artist. It’s a terrible situation. Artists did it to themselves by going along with the hype of the internet promotion, but it will all work its way out one way or the other. So, I've learned the business and how to survive I suppose.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>How long have you been a songwriter? Who initially influenced you? Who do you look to for inspiration these days?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I've been writing songs since 1982. Biggest influence is Joni Mitchell. She continues to inspire. I also love poetry from Rumi and spiritual thoughts and quotations from many others. I’m pretty spiritual .</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/ykukfFACosY?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What may surprise your listeners about how your music is created?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>There are no frills. It's honest and all me, with exception of other players of course. My music comes through me, almost like channeling. Words and music together usually. Often words come to me I don’t even know their meaning -- I have to look them up in context. Its fascinating the way the Muse works. I wrote a song about that on my CD <a href=""http://www.kevinrothmusic.com/adult-music/awakenings/""><em>Awakenings</em></a> called Svengalis Muse.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/bfYZCbZ2KZk?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Your music has a multigenerational appeal. How do you adapt your musical approach for different audiences?</strong><br /><br /><br />	For family audiences with kids, they respond to rhythm and repetition, and songs they know. For adults, its mostly original with a few known pieces of mine and others.Lots of unusual dulcimer especially on my new cosmic dulcimer which has sound holes of planets, moons, stars and actually lights up!</p><br /><br /><p><strong>What do you appreciate most about the Kansas City music scene?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>There’s a lot of jazz. I like jazz. Kansas City is a very artsy town, but just like a lot of towns, the money is tight and its very hard to break in for decent pay. Lots of free gigs out there, but it is what it is. Folk Alliance is also here and they serve a really great purpose.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/3Y6Amkkx7-4?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Kevin's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><em>Hank: The Life of <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&t=smart&search_category=keyword&q=charles+bukowski&commit=Search&searchOpt=catalogue"">Charles Bukowski</a></em> by Neeli Cherkovsky</strong>.

The songs from their first EP, <em>Truest Blue, </em>conjure the dark moods from that period in a way that pays tribute while building upon the musical lineage of, among others, Joy Division, Patsy Cline and Broadcast with subtle shades of soul and pop. The combination makes for music that's thrilling, mysterious and oddly uplifting.

Up until that point, I had no idea she could sing or write songs. I was working on some solo material at the time and had her contribute a verse on one of the tracks. It instantly clicked and sounded better than the stuff I was trying to do on my own. We eventually decided to form as Shadow Rabbits and have her voice and lyrics become the anchor for everything else.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/198967371&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Your list of influences ties together an impressive list of artists who aren</strong><strong>’</strong><strong>t usually linked: Buddy Holly, Joy Division, Patsy Cline, The Drifters, Johnny Cash, Broadcast. What do you see as the common cord between these artists?</strong><br /><br /><br />	ASHLEY: I grew up listening to my grandmother's record collection. She had a wide range of 40s-60s music and I still love that sound until this day. I think the common denominator between the artists that have influenced us is they all deliver a sense of nostalgia with their sound.</p><br /><br /><p>JON: It’s always hard to narrow down all of your influences. The common cord between the ones we chose is the artists, or key members of the band, are now deceased. For me, Broadcast was a band I really started getting into right before Trish Keenan passed away. It created a sense of urgency to carry on what they were doing since I was so heavily inspired by them.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/ZD-iVTCQl14?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Can you point to one time in your life where you knew you wanted to be a songwriter?

As a kid, I’d tinker around with it whenever I visited. That led to me learning different instruments and recording stuff on cassettes.</p><br /><br /><p>ASHLEY: My first love is writing.

Yan's work has been recognized internationally, winning many awards and fellowships, including the 2015 American Prize in New York, the 2008 Vienna Nancy Van de Vate International Composition Prize for Opera, and France's 2011 Marion Tournon-Branly Prize, among many others.

Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I am Yiguo Yan, a native Chinese composer studying in the United States. Before I came to Kansas City to study with Zhou Long and Chen Yi, I’ve lived in several different cities and traveled a lot during my studying and composing. I love literature very much, as well as modern art and so luckily wherever I go, I always meet interesting and talented friends like film directors, architects, writers, or other composers and musicians. We inspired each other to create better works.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/152315428&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/152317454&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>I love the Artist Statement you posted on your website. You make the point that the popular conception of the avant-garde and abstract art need to be reconsidered as ‘normal’ connections between “art history and art future.” Could you describe what makes Kansas City a hub for so many powerful avant-garde composers?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Kansas City is a very quiet and peaceful city where people can focus on their work for a long period of time without being interrupted. The museums of Kansas City display both classical and modern art; the concert halls of Kansas City produce concerts with well-balanced portions of classical and contemporary music. But most importantly is that the composition teachers in UMKC are very open to any styles of music. They encourage students to explore their unique musical languages. They never impose their artistic aesthetics upon their students, nor regulate students in a circle of the so called “academic” or “standard classical contemporary concert pieces.” Many of my colleagues are very good at electronic music and sounds installations. Kansas City has an open attitude towards the art’s future.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/152327388&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/153945887&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What tools do you use for composing? What may surprise a listener about how your music is created?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Before I started to compose, I needed to read some contemporary poems in order to send myself into a world where is full of abstract expressions. Besides reading poems, novels of Virginia Woolf, Marguerite Duras, and Nabokov, plays of Sara Kane, Samuel Beckett, and Sartre can also help me to grab the sense of expressing abstractly and freely.</p><br /><br /><p>What may surprise a listener about how my music is created is that I don’t use MIDI to listen to my draft, I don’t often play on the piano to confirm the sounds from my draft either. Because MIDI and piano can’t accurately restore the real effect of a piece, especially for those pieces with many extended techniques. My last English opera <em>Colors of Obsessions</em> was hand-written and was drafted on two books of staff paper. I heard every minute in my head and the first rehearsal sounds exactly like what I’ve been imagined for four months’ period of composing the opera. MIDI can only play very simple and basic articulations, it cannot generate complex, dimensional, and multi-layered orchestration and counterpoint ideas.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/GSBxWeu6TRE?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/152318434&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How do you move beyond or through creative blocks?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>If I encounter creative blocks, I need to push myself harder to be more creative. Samuel Beckett used to complain to his friend that he was out of inspiration and he felt horrible after he won the Nobel Prize in literature. But he overcame himself and after several years he published one of the most influential contemporary plays, <em>Waiting for Godot</em>. This story can forever encourage me. Every time when I felt like burnt out of ideas, I read <em>Waiting for Godot</em> and think that it was created by Beckett when he thought himself was completely out of ideas, then I got back to work.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/03pweTAE0YY?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you the most about the Kansas City classical music community?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Chen Yi and Zhou Long inspired me the most in Kansas City. They are very generous and kind-hearted people. Actually they are the reason why I came to Kansas City. When I studied with Mario Davidovsky in NYC, he often mentioned them in classes, he said they are very talented, Chen Yi has very impressive musical techniques and Zhou Long is as thoughtful as a philosopher. When I first met them in person on November of 2014 in Carnegie Hall, I was amazed by how humble they are: after their pieces been performed, they helped the players to move some very heavy percussion instruments to their truck. They didn’t act like arrogant celebrities at all. Suddenly I felt so warm and I knew they are the teachers I can totally trust. I’m glad to study with them now. I enjoy talking about anything related to music with them because when they talk, they sound so incisive and profound, they have very deep understanding of art beauty.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Yigou Yan's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>1.<strong> <em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/616493036_one_hundred_years_of_solitude"">One Hundred Years of Solitude</a> </em></strong>by<strong><em> </em></strong>Gabriel Garcia<strong><em> </em></strong>Marquez<br /><br /><br />	2. <strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/43331036_no_exit"">No Exit</a> </em></strong>by Jean-Paul Sartre<br /><br /><br />	3. <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/57636036_the_lover""><strong><em>The Lover</em></strong></a> by Marguerite Duras<br /><br /><br />	4. <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/624015036_orlando""><strong><em>Orlando: A Biography</em></strong></a> by Virginia Woolf<br /><br /><br />	5.<strong><em> <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/2192036_black_spring"">Black Spring</a></em></strong> by Henry Miller<br /><br /><br />	6. <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/367067036_the_dying_animal""><strong><em>The Dying Animal</em></strong></a> by Philip Roth<br /><br /><br />	7. <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/514852036_the_book_of_laughter_and_forgetting""><strong><em>The Book of Laughter and Forgetting</em></strong></a> by Milan Kundera<br /><br /><br />	8. <strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1426770036_lolita"">Lolita</a> </em></strong>by Vladimir<strong><em> </em></strong>Nabokov<br /><br /><br />	9. <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/284340036_the_bell_jar""><strong><em>The Bell Jar</em></strong></a> by Sylvia Plath<br /><br /><br />	10. <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/69960036_the_harvard_book_of_contemporary_american_poetry""><strong><em>The Harvard Book of Contemporary American Poetry</em></strong></a> by Helen Vendler</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/EiXdP6Vmob4?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1459356853","1485192832","0","0","Uncategorizable|Classical|Experimental","classical|experimental|New Music","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/yigou-yan-0","https://yiguoyan.wordpress.com/","Learn more about Yiguo Yan's music here."

As a formally trained classical guitarist and lutenist, Shipe brings new life and new audiences to very old music. His compositions, while heavily steeped in tradition, have their feet placed firmly in the 21st Century. We are fortunate to share this incredible music and Neal's enthusiasm for it with you on Listen Local.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Neal Shipe, I have lived here in Kansas City for about a year and a half. I am a Classical Guitarist/Lutenist and I live in the River Market District of Kansas City. I work as a Barista at Aixois, a French Bistro on 55th and Brookside Blvd.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Tell us about your work on classical Scottish lute music. Why does this music speak to you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I discovered Scottish lute music right around 3 years ago. I was doing my Undergraduate Degree in Classical Guitar performance at University of North Carolina School for the Arts when I discovered a book of Scottish lute music arranged for guitar by Rob MacKillop, a well-known lute player and scholar of Scottish lute music. It was then that I bought that book and fell in love with the Scottish style. The distinctive beauty of a Scottish tune is instantly recognizable and universally enjoyed. Part of what draws me into the music is that distinctive sound.</p><br /><br /><p>Theoretically, it has many tools to give the sound it has. A lot of the Scottish lute repertoire has a modal, pentatonic, and hexatonic nature. Also familiar to the Scottish melodies are scotch snaps, double tonics, wide intervals, frequent ornamentation and tunes ending on notes other than the keynote. These theoretical components of the music lend it to wonderful freedom of expression. More so than any other music I have played. To me it has an improvisatory nature to it, the music can be played to express many emotions (which are always changing day today) so you can never play the piece the same way twice. Scottish lute music taught me to play in moment and express what and how you are feeling in that moment day to day. For me, if those moments of inspiration don't come out then the music feels like a wind-up toy. You just practice and practice and play it to hope it goes exactly how you practice and it is so boring. The fun is the Scottish music’s spontaneity in performance, being in that moment and reacting to those feelings. It is such a healthy thing.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/Ryan%20Headshot.jpg"" width=""4256"" height=""2832"" alt=""Ryan T.

Many of the Scottish Lute manuscripts share the same music. This fact shows us the evolution of the music over time, how interpretation changed, and how music was advancing. I find that very fascinating and it has led me to the creative process of writing and creating my own interpretations. I have definitely taken it to an interested place. Lute music with a band? Why not! Lute music paired with electric guitar, effects pedals, bowed xylophone etc. I like to make 21st Century interpretations of the music. I don't want to be a classical musician that only plays for other classical musicians in classical settings. I want to bring the stuff out, show people by breaking the music out of that “classical” cage it’s in. The journey has lead me to purchasing a 10 course lute and attaining copy of facsimiles of all the Scottish lute manuscripts (Rowallan, Straloch, Skene, Wemyss, Panumure 5 and Balcarres). These 21st Century interpretations often happen with fellow musicians and friends who play different styles but really I have played and performed the music in many different ways. Anything from a full band, to solo guitar, solo lute, guitar duet, and most recently guitar and Ryan Worthley, a really good friend and wonderful musician out of Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/e9whS4Wb4oA?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/254322279&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/254322173&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What are you currently working on?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I am currently working on my first album of Scottish lute music titled, “It is a Wonder to See.” It is really two very different things. First, it is a selection of my Scottish favorites played on the classical guitar, and it also has a second set of pieces that will be a collaboration with guitarist/ percussionist <a href=""http://www.earelec.com/"">Ryan Worthley</a>.</p><br /><br /><p>[A note from Ryan Worthley about his collaboration with Neal:</p><br /><br /><p><em>Never having any formal training in any of these instruments I believe has helped me develop a unique ear for creating interesting harmonies and textures in music. That's why I think this collaboration with Neal has so much potential to be a unique experience because I get to take what he has studied, learned and implemented on guitar and lute and try to amplify what I feel when listening to his work with unique sounds. Whether it is a simple pulse of a drum or an ethereal guitar sound, I try as hard as I can to complement this ancient music without getting in the way of Neal's interpretation of the piece.</em></p><br /><br /><p><em>I feel very comfortable and excited playing with Neal because his passion for what he is doing doesn't only come out in his playing but he lives it. Neal is a very inspiring person to be involved with so it makes this project almost ""easy"" for lack of a better term. He trusts me enough to be able to basically improvise over this ancient music using instruments and technology that are relatively brand new. A few of the instrument are even homemade.

Most of my inspiration comes from friends who do productive things. Whether it’s music, dancing, painting, disc golfing or whatever. Just people simply making the most out of life is inspiring.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Neal's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1157384036_escape_from_camp_14"">Escape From Camp 14</a></strong></em> by Blaine Harden</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&t=smart&search_category=keyword&q=paolini+&commit=Search&searchOpt=catalogue"">Inheritence Cycle: Eragon,Eldest, Brisinger, Inheritance </a></strong></em>by Christopher Paolini</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/754176036_frankenstein,_or,_the_modern_prometheus"">Frankenstein</a></strong></em> by Mary Shelly</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/376795036_the_golden_age_of_english_lute_music"">The Golden age of English Lute Music</a></strong></em> by Julian Bream (CD)</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1033279036_neil_young"">Neil Young: Long May You Run: The Illustrated History</a></strong></em> by Daniel Durchholz</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/499206036_majikat"">Cat Stevens: Majikat</a></strong></em> (DVD)</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/486025036_reflections_of_spain"">Reflections on Spain</a></strong></em> by David Russell (CD)</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/206980036_mans_search_for_meaning"">Man's Search for Meaning</a></strong></em> by Viktor E.

The sounds themselves are challenging and evocative. However, they take on new life when heard within the context of her many multimedia projects and collaborations with modern dancers, performance artists, videographers and spoken word artists. Busch seeks to do nothing less than ""reinvent the concert experience."" In her interview, she expands on this philosophy, why many of her influences are ""non-musical"" and how Kansas City has inspired her work.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Hi! My name is Stacy Busch and I currently live and work in Kansas City, Missouri.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Describe your music for new listeners. Who or what are your influences?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>One major goal for my music is to engage broader audiences than current music that is played in the concert hall setting. I didn’t grow up studying music, and I am still constantly surprised that I’ve wound up in music school surrounded by a culture I’ve never felt fully apart of. So, I like writing music that is relatable, even though it may sometimes be provocative. I prefer writing electronic music, music for percussion, and vocal music. My major influences are, strangely, usually not musical. I am inspired by women who have succeeded by being themselves. Namely, Tina Fey, Patti Smith, Marina Abramovic and Sophia Coppola.</p><br /><br /><p>Artistic collaboration is always part of the immediate inspiration for any project. This is because my ideas are all inclusive. I do not get inspired to write a piece of music, I usually get inspired to create some type of artistic event that involves an array of different mediums. I love developing a team of creative people and I love showing a performance that’s truly in the grey area in terms of genre. Of course I end up writing a bunch of music but that’s not usually the impetus for the project. I have large, blank sheets of paper that line my walls and I scribble ideas and drawings and random stuff on them with sharpies. This is where the really early ideas get fleshed out. But when it comes down to writing music, I use Logic, Ableton and Sibelius.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/150824977&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>The first thing visitors to your website see is the statement “Let’s reinvent the concert experience.” Describe the work you do to enable this reinvention.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>To me, reinventing the concert experience is about maintaining the ways the traditional concert is effective and changing the ways that it isn’t. For example, quality music and a quality concept are both great advantages of the concert hall. But, viewership is drastically declining and I think that’s because there’s a lack of humanity in it. It can appear sterile and untouchable. So I try to create events that get people involved more in the actual space, and invested more emotionally. Bringing the performers off the stage and onto the main floor, allowing audience members to see, touch and smell, and using concepts that are human, relatable and engaging are some ways to make the experience more engaging. At the end of the day, it’s about creating a memorable experience and utilizing a feeling of impulsivity that I find people respond to.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/161561674&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/157080642&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you the most about the Kansas City classical and electronic music communities?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I moved to Kansas City because I felt the community was very inviting, vibrant and invested in growing. There is a strong network of all types of creative people in the city, and that was immediately apparent and inspiring to me. I think the most inspiring aspect about it is that you feel apart of something that’s building itself from the ground up. I like that idea and I really respect the artists in this community because of that.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/6iDNPr6MSh8?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Stacy's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1415087036_m_train"">M Train</a></strong> </em>by<em> </em>Patti Smith</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/704560036_robert_schumann""><em>Robert Schumann: Life and Death of a Musician</em> and </a></strong><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/704560036_robert_schumann"">T.S.

Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I am Elizabeth (Eli) Hougland, and I live in KC and work at Hallmark as part of the Retail Technology team. I’m a part of the help desk for the retailers and owners of Hallmark stores. I grew up in a suburb of KC—Lee’s Summit, and have been living in the city for the past 6 years.</p><br /><br /><p>I went to college at UMKC for Music Composition. I started violin at the age of 4 and started composing when I was 16. I also play viola, which I picked up around age 14 or so. I can’t sing or play the piano to save my life, though.</p><br /><br /><p>My emphasis in college was music technology, and I have been teaching myself different programming languages since leaving college. My main focuses are HTML and Python. I became fascinated with Artificial Intelligence while in school, and always wanted to combine my music with robotics and technology, but don’t have the complete know-how yet.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/232363634&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your music for new listeners. Who are your influences? How has the music you create evolved over time?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My music generally falls into one of three categories: ambient, atmospheric, and very tonal; rhythmic, sample based, and inspired by glitch; or over-the-top, cheesy instrumental writing.</p><br /><br /><p>For the past couple years I have composed either collaborative installation works, or works for Mnemosyne Quartet, which I play in. I moved over to writing music with electronics pretty quickly after starting college.</p><br /><br /><p>Influences? Anything and everything. I grew up listening to violin solo rep and symphonic literature because my mom taught violin. I like metal, bunch of British rock, alternative/ experimental rock. Some specific bands/ artists include: They Might be Giants, Avenged Sevenfold, Muse, Ben Folds, Brian Eno, Paul Lanksy, and Laurie Anderson.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/122780078&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What tools do you use to compose and perform?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I use Logic and Sibelius for almost every project.

I do a lot of fixed media, which means I just worry about running sound rather than performing. I use a standalone program created from supercollider and Reaktor for when I do perform live. I also use Logic for playing live.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" id=""vimeo-154892465"" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/154892465?width=640&height=360&color=00adef&portrait=1&title=1&byline=1&autoplay=0&loop=0&player_id=vimeo-154892465"" frameborder=""0"" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Tell us about your live sound design label and publishing company Eli-Tronics.

About a year ago, Michael Miller came up with that name, and handed me a score with my part labeled as “Eli-Tronics.” It just sort of stuck.</p><br /><br /><p>I’m most interested in installations and doing sound design for a specific space—and I don’t mean sound design like in film scoring. I want to create and recreate spaces sonically, and have been exploring this the most with Mnemosyne Quartet. However, I want to do a more permanent installation soon on my own. I also want to recreate these spaces after the installation online, and publish them somehow, thus why I call it a sound design label.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" id=""vimeo-92365739"" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/92365739?width=640&height=360&color=00adef&portrait=1&title=1&byline=1&autoplay=0&loop=0&player_id=vimeo-92365739"" frameborder=""0"" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you the most about the Kansas City experimental music scene?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The opportunities I’ve gotten here.

I got to design sound for a room in the Nelson Atkins Museum as part of the Composers in the Gallery series. I positioned speakers underneath paintings and created a soundtrack for each speaker. I was most interested in the space in the middle and how they could combine. That’s one of my favorite things I’ve been able to do here. Added to that has been working with Art in the Loop, Charlotte Street, and of course the Library!</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/97469879&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p>Several picks:</p><br /><br /><ol><li>I love to listen to audiobooks in the car.

What songs are you most proud of?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em>Right as Rain</em> is an album that I released in May of 2015. I had been working on it for about a year. It was recorded in my house in Kansas City over several sessions. Ross Brown (of cool KC band Fullbloods) recorded most of the songs and helped me fill out the ones that I started on my own. Ross also mixed it. It was mastered at Westend Recording Studio by Mike Nolte. Almost a year out from the release now I am still proud of that record. My personal favorites from it are “In Good Time” and “Nothing Like You”.</p><br /><br /><p>More recently I have completed and released a new EP. It’s called <em>Mirror Music no.1</em> and it was released in January of 2016. The songs were recording over the same sessions for my last full length, <em>Right As Rain, </em>but were saved to be used for this release. <em>Right As Rain</em> and <em>Mirror Music no.1</em> are linked and draw on the same themes. This music is a about abandonment, bitterness and repressed anger. In a way the EP kind of closes the book on that period of song writing for me. I've had an extremely eventful year and I'm writing a lot of new tunes about all of that. So this project also works as a nice little taste to hold everyone over until the new album makes it out.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/178479788&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p>While many of your lyrics are introspective, your music is very melodic and hook-driven in a way that recalls classic pop. What do you find most fulfilling and challenging about working within this musical model? I try not to overthink things like that. I generally just let the songs come to me and attempt to fill them out the way I hear them in my head. I try not to give myself many options as far as “musical models” go. The music that I make is kind of a mixture of everything I liked listening to growing up. A well-written pop song is one of the most satisfying things for me to experience. But I also love introspective, quickly lyrics that give you insight into the writer’s individual human experience. I’m just trying to make music that I would want to listen to. The biggest challenge is that it is difficult and I often fail. The most fulfilling thing is when I get it right.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/qjv3oWOtRkk?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What artists do you look to these days for inspiration?

Her creative reach even extends to music she composes for the Javanese and Balinese <a href=""http://www.balibeyond.com/gamelan.html"">gamelan</a>. Currently a UMKC doctoral student in composition, Butera's work has been performed in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. We are excited to share an interview with Butera about her creative process, her Johnson County Library recommendations, as well as samples of her music.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong><br /><br /><br />	Hi! My name is Christina, and while I am originally from New Jersey, I now live and work in Kansas City, MO. I am a doctoral student in composition at UMKC. I am the TA in the recording studio at the conservatory, which means part of my job involves attending and recording conservatory concerts and recitals. I also teach as an adjunct instructor at Kansas City Kansas Community College in the Audio Engineering department. My typical day involves a mix of attending my own classes at UMKC and traveling to KCKCC to teach. This is sometimes followed by recording a conservatory event at night. After that, I go home, cook dinner, have some coffee or wine (depending on my mood) and compose. I am a night owl at heart, and this is often when I feel most energized. As a result, I end up doing much of my composing late at night.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Delve a little into your own process of composing. What may surprise a listener of your music about how you create it? What tools do you use?</strong><br /><br /><br />	My process is always evolving. I almost always start by collecting my materials and figuring out how to organize them. If I am composing for a specific ensemble, I begin sorting out what types of timbres, gestures, harmonies, and/or melodic lines I am interested in using. If I am working on an electronic piece, I collect my materials by collecting sounds, which often influence and shape the resulting piece. After I have my materials, I map out the structure of the piece, usually in some visual form. I begin by composing into that structure and, in time, almost always end up deviating from or completely abandoning it.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/224500197&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/224500124&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Can you point to one time in your life where you knew you wanted to be a composer? Who inspired you early on to create new music and what were your earliest compositions like?</strong><br /><br /><br />	Honestly, I wanted to become a composer as soon as I realized I could major in it in college. My clarinet teacher was always training me to be a professional musician, and I never questioned it. I was writing music on the side for fun, without a teacher. I would write music for my friends and me to play, which lead to a lot of clarinet and piano music. I knew I wanted to go to college to study music, and when I began looking into music programs for performance, I came across undergraduate composition programs. I never really thought about pursuing it as a career until then. All I can say is that my earliest compositions were very tonal and contrapuntal (and full of backwards stems, unmarked meter changes, and accidental key changes.… College helped with that).</p><br /><br /><p><strong>In addition to your solo, electroacoustic and ensemble work, you have also written for the Balinese and Javanese gamelans. How did you become acquainted with these instruments? How did your creative process change as a result of working with them?</strong><br /><br /><br />	I became acquainted with gamelan at Bucknell University, where I did my undergrad. I played in the Javanese gamelan there and had the honor of writing a piece for them. When I moved on to Bowling Green State University, I played in their Balinese gamelan and worked with them on another piece. Gamelan is an entirely different experience from playing in Western ensembles. The tuning, musical structure, rehearsal methods, and ensemble hierarchy were all new to me. These aspects definitely infiltrated and influenced my creative process as I was working on these pieces. I incorporated traditional techniques and interlocking ornamentations into non-traditional elements of rhythm and harmony. I also worked with a structure that was cyclical rather than linear, which lead me to compose from the inside out. The use of interlocking patterns is definitely something that has permeated many of my pieces since then.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>What do you love most about incorporating electronic elements into your compositions?</strong><br /><br /><br />	Incorporating electronic elements into my compositions essentially opens up the entire world to me. I am a timbral composer, and working with electronics means I have every timbre imaginable at my disposal. It is exciting, liberating, and intimidating all at the same time.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Who or what inspires you now?</strong><br /><br /><br />	I find inspiration in different things every day. Often times, it’s my family, Sicilian folk traditions, my musical peers, or even just everyday events. At this moment, I’m inspired by the impending fall. Nothing make me feel creatively charged like the beautiful colors and crisp air of fall.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/224499728&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/224499415&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Christina's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/314497036_the_perks_of_being_a_wallflower"">The Perks of Being A Wallflower </a>by Stephen Chbosky</strong><br /><br /><br />	This was my favorite book in high school.

How did you meet and end up combining forces?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Well the four of us come from different corners of the country. Michael and Russell have known each other for almost 20 years and are both from Oklahoma, Ted grew up in upstate New York, and Eli is from the Kansas City area. All four of us have been active in the Kansas City new music scene for the past few years, and it was through this community that we came to know one another. Last summer (2014) Ted, Michael, and Russell began to improvise together and were soon joined by Eli. In August that year we had our first public performance in Oppenstein Park as part of Art in the Loop’s inaugural season, and have been performing regularly since then.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/218383560&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/218380874&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>The improvisational/ambient aspect of the music you create is very intriguing. You incorporate sounds from the environment, building on native bird songs, for example. How did this musical approach come about? How is it informed by the music you each do individually?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>We’re very interested in how human brains process the information in their environment and seek to exploit certain cognitive facts to our musical advantage. Through many hours of discussion, as well as playing, we have come to a common vocabulary which we use to improvise and ultimately manipulate the listener’s environment. Each project we take on requires rehearsal and research, culminating in a unique piece and performance. After a year of projects we now have a catalog of works that we are evolving with every performance. This stems from changes in the performance environment and the improvisational nature of our music. A lot of our approach stems from the Art in the Loop performance as it was in a very public and nomadic setting. Ultimately we hope to grab the attention of our listeners, however brief it is, and bring their attention to something in the environment they were unaware was even there.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/218378821&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What are your biggest creative challenges as an improvisational quartet? Do you encounter creative blocks? How do you move beyond them?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The biggest challenge is trying to integrate of all our musical voices into a distinct and cohesive 30-45 performance. We all have varied musical backgrounds and tastes, but we find that once we have a project in mind these differences actually help. Our playing also appeals to a wide variety of audiences; whether it’s Russell’s fast bebop harmonies, Eli’s epic soundscapes, Michael’s schmaltzy melodies, or Ted’s funky grooves.</p><br /><br /><p>In our rehearsals we are constantly always making sure we remember and write down what we just did in a particularly inspiring practice improvisation so we can recreate that particular mood in a public performance. This helps us create some continuity between performances, but also serves as a way to move beyond any creative blocks.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Each of you are heavily involved in the vibrant Kansas City experimental music scene. What’s the best thing about living, working and performing here?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>How much we see people who make music wanting to work together to make quality stuff. It’s the support for art and artists. We see art as a huge part of the culture in KC, and it’s all thanks to the community that continues to come out and engage with it. That and the opportunities to play in non-traditional spaces like parks, rooftops, libraries, galleries, etc..</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" id=""vimeo-123497537"" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/123497537?width=640&height=360&color=00adef&portrait=1&title=1&byline=1&autoplay=0&loop=0&player_id=vimeo-123497537"" frameborder=""0"" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p> </p><br /><br /><p>Ted recommends <strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/658223036_the_hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galaxy"">Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy</a> by Douglas Adams</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Michael recommends <strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/563743036_the_13_12_lives_of_captain_bluebear"">The 13 1/2 Lives of Captain Blue Bear</a> by Walter Moers</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Russell recommends <strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/387611036_the_years_of_rice_and_salt"">The Years of Rice and Salt</a> by Kim Stanley Robinson</strong></p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1443718453","1484770728","0","0","Uncategorizable|Eclectic|Experimental|Jazz","jazz|improvisation|ambient|experimental","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/mnemosyne-quartet","https://mnsquartet.wordpress.com/","Learn more about the Mnemosyne Quartet here."

Initiated in 2015 by <a href=""http://scottsteelecomposer.com/"">Scott Steele</a>,<a href=""http://www.tedkingsmith.com/"">Ted King-Smith</a> and <a href=""http://www.zanewinter.com/"">Zane Winter</a>, <a href=""http://www.fuseboxnewmusic.org/"">FuseBox New Music </a>""champions new music by providing composers with commissions, performances, recordings, and collaborative opportunities, all with a special emphasis on emerging local composers."" FuseBox New Music seeks to raise awareness of the incredible amount of talent and original music being created in the Kansas City area by offering innovative concert experiences and forging new community partnerships. Scott, Ted and Zane were kind enough to shed more light on this exciting project. Read on.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>What’s FuseBox all about? How did you three come to collaborate on this project?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>It started with Zane Winter inviting Ted King-Smith and me to help organize a few new music concerts around town. FuseBox as it is today evolved through weekly coffee meetings at two local shops (Pirate’s Bone Coffee & Crows). Overtime, the scope of what we were hoping to accomplish expanded and our overall mission became clearer:</p><br /><br /><p>We are new music advocates.</p><br /><br /><p>We want to create projects for composers and musicians in which everyone benefits. Too many composers’ opportunities exploit emerging composers. FuseBox aims to provide its participants with fair pay for their work and tools to advance their careers such as quality recordings. We’d rather teach others to fish than merely feed them. Since launching in 2015, we have commissioned 5 composers.</p><br /><br /><p>Community is also very important to us. We support musicians by paying union wage for our events. We have worked to partner with local organizations, from big names like the Roasterie to fairly new businesses like Torn Label, to share audiences through cross promotion. Again, it is about creating situations in which everybody wins.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about the upcoming Debussy Project. What is it about Debussy’s work that inspired this idea?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The Debussy Project is a marriage of artistry and practicality. We never merely throw pieces together on a program. The overall experience of each FuseBox event is carefully curated.</p><br /><br /><p>We imagined a concert in which an older, multi-movement work is separated out to form the frame for a new, single piece. It would be comprised of the original movements plus newly commissioned ones in between.</p><br /><br /><p>Debussy’s attractive color palette, assertive choice of instrumentation, and the widespread awareness of his work made the Sonata an obvious choice for this collaboration. Debussy’s influence on contemporary composition is undeniable; The Debussy Project provides composers and listeners an opportunity to dialogue with one of the most revered composers of the 20th century.</p><br /><br /><p>You can hear The Debussy Project at 7:30pm on October 1 and 4, 2015 at Prairie Logic in downtown KC, MO.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/225578139&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How did the Harmony Project Commission come about?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The Harmony Project Commission is the direct result of our interest in community and audience building. By connecting the kids in the Harmony Project with a living composer, we are fostering an awareness of contemporary composition. This in turn helps to build tomorrow’s audiences. It is a rare experience for music students to take part in the process of creating a new work so early in their education -- such experiences paint music and composition as a living, breathing art form.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What’s ahead for Fusebox?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>FuseBox has many new projects on the horizon, all involving the creation of new works.</p><br /><br /><p><em>Long Dream of the Fisherman’s Son </em>is an opera being composed by FuseBox co-founder Zane Winter to a libretto by Ethan Grant, a Chicago-based writer. <em>Long Dream </em>is an abstract retelling of the English folk ballad<em>Scarborough</em><em> Fair, </em>which explores gender roles, disillusionment, and relationships in contemporary society. The process of building the ensemble for <em>Long Dream </em>is at the heart of the project.</p><br /><br /><p>FuseBox is actively developing an ensemble which, through blending instruments and sounds from many disparate musical traditions, comments on the ways in which cultures interact in a multicultural society.</p><br /><br /><p>We are also working toward a partnership with another organization that works to bring musical fulfillment to children. The project will involve instrument creation and multiple commissions for new music by emerging composers. We are looking forward to announcing more details when the project goes public.</p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1443200053","1484772526","0","0","Uncategorizable","advocacy","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/fusebox-new-music","http://www.fuseboxnewmusic.org/","Learn more about FuseBox New Music here."

Who were your earliest musical influences? How did you come to learn what you need to know to create your music?</em></strong></p><br /><br /><p>My parents were definitely my earliest musical influences. They're both brilliant musicians, and I'm very lucky to have had them around to pass that along to me. I have two sisters, and the five of us were constantly singing together. It's how I learned to harmonize. Imogen Heap has been a huge artistic influence, especially regarding my process. She's a true independent, and that's what I love about her. Her ability to create soundscapes and weave emotion into the music is something I've always tried to emulate in my own way.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/wZOL9ulPjWU?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong><em>Describe your creative process with songwriting and recording, especially with the songs on your second album, Spectrum. What songs are you most proud of and why?</em></strong></p><br /><br /><p>There seems to be two kinds of songwriters: those who write lyrics before they write the music, and those who hear the music before they write lyrics. For me, the music comes first. It always seems to be the product of an emotion for me, something that I feel I have to express to the degree that the feeling itself takes on a life of its own in the form of music. The more I develop a song, the more life it takes on. Finally it gets to the point where I'm able to ask ""What is the music trying to say?"" That's when I have to get cerebral and give it words. Every song I've written is a product of my heart, soul, and mind.</p><br /><br /><p>The songs I'm most proud of from <em>Spectrum</em> are ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow"" and ""Seventeen"". They both contain messages that are very important to me, but are so can be so easily forgotten: that I am loved, and that I matter. I've battled for most of my life, and have survived suicide attempts once as a teen, then again as a young adult. I'm proud of those songs, because I know firsthand that they have impacted others that have gone through similar circumstances. My hope is that the stories I've heard aren't the only ones out there, and that what I'm doing in music is creating a positive difference.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/E9PwtkcVcWo?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong><em>What artists do you look to these days for inspiration? What do you admire most about these artists?</em></strong></p><br /><br /><p>I admire the Imogen Heaps, the Taylor Swifts, the Tove Los, and the Macklemores of the world. They're the renegades that dare to write their own music and speak their minds. They're not afraid to be original and take chances. They inspire me to be true to my art. Authenticity is the most relatable component of good music; people are drawn to it because it's such a terrifying thing to practice in your own life. I aspire to that level of authenticity both on and off the stage, but I sometimes fall short. Those kinds of artists keep me accountable.</p><br /><br /><p><strong><em>What most excites you about music and creativity in Kansas City?</em></strong></p><br /><br /><p>I love that there's always something going on. I love great venues like the Tank Room that are constantly changing things up and giving new artists a shot. I love that First Fridays is a place for both music and the visual arts. Kansas City celebrates creativity in all its forms, something that I think will only spark a nuclear reaction of amazing things.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/156052515&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/156052262&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Check out these book recommendations from Dustin:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1353252036_being_mortal"">Being Mortal</a> by Atul Gawande.</strong> This book gave me incredible perspective on how wonderful it is to be alive and healthy.

Pulled from everyday experiences of family, childhood, ""old dogs"" and growing older, the Independence, Missouri, resident's songs paint a picture of life that is personal yet steeped in a musical lineage. Garrett performs regularly, usually with a guitar and harmonica, though you'll also occasionally find him with dobro, banjo, dulcimer or ukulele. It's a pleasure to welcome Larry Garrett to Listen Local.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourself. Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I'm Larry Garrett. I'm a folksinger/songwriter. My wife and I live in Independence, Mo. We're both retired and spend quite-a-bit of time running around together, watching our grandkids, and when we can, relaxing. My alone time typically consist of me working on my music. Either writing or playing an instrument. I usually play a guitar (sometimes using a harmonica with it), but can also be found at times with a dobro, banjo, dulcimer, or ukulele. I'm at home with the guitar, but know just enough of the others to get myself in trouble. Just recently began spending some time with a keyboard.</p><br /><br /><p>I also play a lot of music around town at coffeehouses, churches, festivals, parks, and at outdoor markets when time permits. I play some covers too if the venue allows them, but mostly my own songs about my family and friends. I started playing music in public places in the mid-80's. Did folk music programs for Mid-Continent Libraries in the 90's. Songs about grandma and grandpa, aunts and uncles, old dogs, misfits, and neighbors are typical of what I write. Seems like I'm busier now than ever before. If someone had told me back then, ""When you're in your 60's you're going to be a folksinger/songwriter and performing numerous times each month,"" I'd have laughed at them. But, here I am. You never know what life has waiting for you around the next corner, so keep walking.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/u6287zD__IY?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Can you point to one time in your life where you knew you wanted to be a songwriter? Who or what inspired you early on to create music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I don't think I can point to just one time when I knew. It's been an on-going process. I started-out writing poetry and short stories, years before I wrote my first song. Actually, my very first songs were poems I had written years before. When I first got the bug to write my own songs I figured some of my poems were already a good start, so I'd add a chorus and a bridge to the poem. Maybe re-write part of it to make it more song-friendly. That's kind of how I started writing songs. For years, most of my songs were very wordy. It was almost as if I was trying to sing one of my short stories. However, I finally learned how to keep only what's necessary to tell the basics of the story in a 3-4 minute song and let the listener add the rest with their own imagination.</p><br /><br /><p>Although songwriting wasn't my first interest in writing, it gradually moved to the forefront and now it's most of what I write. It's not so much that I have to write. I want to write. I feel I've got something to say and express in what I call my ""slice of life"" songs. I’m kind of doing living a dream. I’m singing folk songs about folks all over the KC area.</p><br /><br /><p>In regard to who first inspired me to write music, I believe it was the songwriters of the late 50's thru the 60's. I've always been a big folk music fan. While I liked The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, etc., I really focused on people like Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, Joanie Mitchell, Gordon Lightfoot, and Judy Collins. They're all storytellers and I had an interest in that even before I started writing songs. My songs tell stories about people I’ve known and situations I’ve been in.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/204460806&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/204634343&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your creative process with songwriting. How do you move through creative blocks or struggles?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I typically write the lyrics before I come-up with any music. Don't believe I've ever written the music first. After I've got a few lines written, I might start thinking of a melody for what I've got so far. That's what works for me. Each songwriter, at whatever level of expertise they've attained, has his/her own approach. Everyone is different.</p><br /><br /><p>My own creative process involves routines that keep me in the ""slice of life"" mode. It's tied to what friends call my theme song: ""My Old Neighborhood."" Literally everything I've written has some kind of link to that song. I'm looking for a song that has a life lesson about it and I'm looking to connect that with something from my own life. Something my parents did, or my grandmother said, or maybe something about a neighbor from my childhood. Some of my songs, like ""Grandma's Prayer"" and ""Grandma's House"" (I've got a bunch of grandma songs) come directly from my childhood. The content of the songs is something I personally know. That's the kind of material I look for when I write. I just finished a song called ""Grandpas and Old Dogs."" Got the idea from one of my granddaughters when she asked me if all grandpas have old dogs. Turned-out to be one of those songs where everything falls easily into place.</p><br /><br /><p>Another thing I find helpful is to go outside on our back deck at 2-3 in the morning. The solitude, darkness, and silence are relaxing and help clear my mind. Just me and my ghosts. Not trying to sound dramatic, but it is a good time to put some thoughts together.</p><br /><br /><p>Every now-and-then I run into a real mental block. Can't get anywhere on a song. Maybe I can't even get a song started, or perhaps I've got 3-4 lines and can't find my way to the next line. Or perhaps I've got a ""killer"" chorus that I can't build anything else around. Sometimes I've just got to walk-away from the song for a while. Maybe when I come back to it I'll think of a new line or find a different direction. Then again, maybe I won't. I've got several songs that are years and years old that for whatever reason I haven't finished. At times I'll go back and look at them to see if anything new shows-up. At other times, I might pirate a couple lines or get an idea for another song.</p><br /><br /><p>One thing I do to avoid writer's block is to not waste a lot of time with it. If I'm truly stuck on a song, I put it to the side and move to something else. The ""something else"" might be one of the unfinished songs mentioned above or it might be just taking the dog for a walk. Also, when I've hit a wall, I might start looking at old family photographs. Many of my songs were inspired by photos that are decades old. Again, the ""My Old Neighborhood"" theme. That's the kind of inspiration I look for. Whatever I do, I just don't let myself get bogged down on one song. I keep moving, even if the moving has nothing to do with writing.</p><br /><br /><p>I don't follow a specific set of rules when songwriting. I'm trying to tell a story with my songs and I just go where the story takes me. I'll try to make room for a bridge and a chorus, but there are times I don't use them.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/Mzhm7SyWx4k?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You have cited artists like Johnny Cash, Emmylou Harris and Townes Van Zant, among others, as influences. What do you admire most about these artists?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I think artists like these connect with people on a human level. Their music cuts-through all the hype and noise. I can listen to the lyrics and feel I have a personal link to them. What they’re saying in the song makes me feel like I’ve “been there and done that” too.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>What most excites you about music and creativity in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I really enjoy and benefit from the songwriter community in the Kansas City area. It helps create venues for performing and gives local songwriters opportunities to expand their craft, connect with other songwriters and musicians, and offers local business the chance to bring ""live music"" to their location. My contacts with other Kansas City songwriters has led to what I do today. I play venues all-around the area. I've been playing at Gusto's Coffeehouse in Lee's Summit every Wednesday at Noon for almost three years now. Been playing at Foo's Custard in Leawood every month for over five years. I'm part of The Kansas City Songwriters Circle and I host a Songwriter Circle event every month. My good friend David Hakan is the co-founder and this group and has kept it vibrant and active for almost two decades now. It's a great way to meet other songwriters while you perform your original songs. My good friend Jim Abel and I have been playing the Missouri Town 1855 Folk Festival for eight years. Jim and I met at a Songwriters Circle venue. My buddy Duane Woner, and I played Lee's Summit Farmers Market for seven years. We met each other at a Songwriters Circle event. I met Kathy Forste, one of the owners of KC Cafe Internet Radio, at a Songwriters Circle venue many years ago. Kathy and I have shared the stage at numerous music venues throughout the years. I'm even a board member for KC Cafe.</p><br /><br /><p>Several years ago, I started sending-out emails to a couple of dozen songwriters I knew as a way for us to stay-in-touch and be aware of each other's gigs. More and more local folks started sending me info on other area music, so the email list grew. I started calling it my ""Weekly Bulletin."" I've now got nearly 300 people on that email list. Most are songwriters and musicians. The rest are people who like to attend ""live music"" venues. They'll show-up at festivals, churches, and coffeehouses. I send out this bulletin once (sometimes twice) each week with information on who is playing where, etc. It's just something I started doing and it's grown. All this comes from the creativity in Kansas City's songwriter community. Once you get involved, there are lots of opportunities.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/204908938&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/204669389&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Larry's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/330527036_to_kill_a_mockingbird"">To Kill A Mockingbird</a> by Harper Lee.</strong> First read this in High School.

His new solo EP, <em>Uniform, </em>is an impressive display of his songwriting, instrumentation and production skills. (He plays all the drums, bass, guitar, keyboards and vocals himself, and serves as co-producer.) We are excited to share Jack's new music with you and give you a glimpse into how he balances his musical and academic pursuits.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about your new solo EP, <em>Uniform.</em> What inspired it? What songs are you most proud of?  </strong></p><br /><br /><p>I decided to release ""Uniform"" because there were a lot of songs that I have written over the course of this year that don't necessarily fit Tall Tales' vibe. However, I wanted these songs to be heard, and I wanted to launch a new project different from what I've already done with the band. I am especially proud of ""Wrong or Right"", the first track on the album because it was actually one of the first songs I've ever written. I had dozens of songs to choose from for the record, but after all these years I don't think any of them could beat the catchy melodies in ""Wrong or Right"". So I decided to include it.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/Ingram_uniform.jpg"" width=""320"" height=""320"" alt=""Jack Ingram"" title=""Jack Ingram"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/226062547&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/226062544&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong><em>Uniform</em></strong><strong>’s sound is super-polished and obviously the result of a lot of hard studio work.

I co-produced the tracks with my good friend Christian Horton who also recorded ""It's Just a Game"" for Tall Tales. Christian and I have been working together for a long time now which makes the process really easy. Although, the EP took a long time to record because I had to pause halfway through the process to record ""It's Just a Game"" for Tall Tales. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/226062543&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/226062534&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What are your plans as a solo artist while Tall Tales is still an active band? What distinguishes Jack Ingram, solo artist, material from Tall Tales material? </strong></p><br /><br /><p>While I will definitely promote this album and use it as a marketing platform for myself, Tall Tales is my focus and my main songwriting/performance outlet. I will continue to play shows with Tall Tales and would rather do that in the first place because I love being in a band. The thing that is most different about this EP is that it is so diverse in its musical styles. Everything from bright dance pop to a folk rock ballad. That's why I ironically titled this EP ""Uniform"" as everything on it is so different. Tall Tales definitely has its own style, which again, is why I thought doing this EP was so important.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/226062535&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/226062533&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Who or what currently inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I've been influenced by a lot of different sources throughout the years.

We are excited to present an interview with Wang in which she discusses, among other things, balancing life between the U.S. and China and how living in Kansas City has influenced her productivity, in addition to her picks from the Johnson County Library catalog.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Wang A Mao. Wang is my last name, A Mao is my first name. I prefer to go by the Chinese way, putting my last name at the beginning. Currently, I am a doctoral student (ABD) in music composition at the University of Missouri Kansas City, and I divide my professional and personal life between the US and China while pursuing my studies. </p><br /><br /><p>I like to schedule my day in three main slots, to be able to better arrange my agenda. In the morning, I usually work on the paper works, or other things related, but definitely not composing. I am not a morning person, and I start to give the best of me only later in the day. That is why it is in the afternoon that I begin focusing on composition: writing music, playing music, doing researches, checking music online, etc. After dinner, ideally just relaxing and chilling if there is no deadline approaching. Otherwise, just finish my work before going to bed. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/226964884&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You're originally from Beijing. How did you come to study music composition at UMKC?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I studied at Central Conservatory of Music (CCoM) in Beijing where I met Dr. Chen Yi in 2007. I only took a few master classes with her, but I was already truly impressed by her personality and her music, and also by her approach to teaching. Upon graduating, I felt that I wanted to experience a different setting, deepen my studies in a distant environment. My parents were really supportive, because they strongly believe the way to help children to grow better and faster is to let them out of the familiar nest. I spent then a year working really hard to study English in order to pass the required language exams, and finally I applied for the University of Missouri-Kansas City. It was not easy, but it was certainly worth the effort.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/141227476&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Delve a little into your own process of composing. What may surprise a listener of your music about how you create it? What tools do you use?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I start picking a theme I want to write about. It can come from the most various sources: a poem, a painting, a stage work, or a landscape. Then, I delve into music. I listen to a lot of various works before starting writing my own piece. Learning things from the masters and contemporaries is crucial for personal growth.</p><br /><br /><p>When a little motif comes up, I will explore the possibilities of the potential thousand different metamorphoses of this single cell: sitting in front of the piano, I will play around with this small particle, writing down all the possible transfigurations and ideas.</p><br /><br /><p>My mentors always suggested to think more about the concept of the structure of the work, so I spend hours and hours to develop all these ideas to shape the piece. The interesting part is that from time to time these ideas will be the inspiration to take back previous works to improve them. Composition is a never-ending work in progress.</p><br /><br /><p>The tools for my composing process are actually very simple, I would say almost “vintage”: staff paper, pencil and a piano, and of course, a computer.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/226981402&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>I'm fascinated by your incredibly diverse list of music 'likes' on Facebook.

What music are you currently passionate about?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>When I have to choose what to listen, I just follow my mood and my feelings. Every tiny little thing could affect the next playlist, which has one real main theme: to be as diverse as possible. Some times is surprising to see from where your inspiration could come from.</p><br /><br /><p>Lately, I have been listening to Gin Wigmore, a singer and songwriter from New Zealand, who has triggered my interest. <em>Iron </em>by Woodkid is also an impressive song, both in its original version and quintet version. In terms of Contemporary Classical music, I could mention some concertos by Akira Nishimura; Giya Kancheli's Symphony No.5 ""To the Memory of My Parents""; John Adams' <em>Son of Chamber </em>Symphony. Those are truly masterpieces.</p><br /><br /><p>Since I will be collaborating with some Chinese instrument performers, I am currently listening to some classic repertoire from the Chinese tradition music.  </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/140796636&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What's something you struggle with creatively?

I want to establish my own voice, but also want to do something new to challenge myself. Now I am trying to find inspirations in other artistic forms, not restraining my mind, creating collaborations with the most diverse artists, consulting with professionals, and, above all, trying each time to apply at least one thing I have never utilized before in my previous works. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/226982184&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>How has living in Kansas City (or America for that matter) influenced your work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Enormously. First of all, living in the United States has helped me to compose more. Five years ago, I usually just completed one work per year. Ever since I came to the States, various activities, workshops, and projects have stimulated my compositional motivation. In terms of music itself, living in the States has freed my mind significantly. Anything could influence my music, regardless the genre: classical, avant-garde, contemporary, pop, jazz, or rock'n roll. Sky is the limit, as people say.</p><br /><br /><p>Moreover, there are more collaborating projects in America: everyone can apply or, even better, be actually a founder of an event. Plus, we are not limited to collaborate only with other musicians. I can write music and perform together with dancers or painters, giving me the chance to absorb different artistic concepts from the most disparate genres.  </p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Amao's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1306615036_conjurer"">Conjurer</a> </em>by John Corigliano</strong></p><br /><br /><p>All time favorite.

Their brand-new debut album, <a href=""http://theamtrio.bandcamp.com/album/as-of-now""><em>As of Now</em></a>, showcases Murray's songwriting talent. An instructor for The Music School and an accompanist for the Kansas City Ballet, Murray is also an established freelance performer in her own right, holding a Bachelor of Music degree in Jazz Studies from the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Please enjoy this interview with Murray about her craft, what her current inspirations are, and her book, music and movie recommendations.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you? </strong></p><br /><br /><p>I’m a pianist, vocalist and songwriter currently residing in midtown Kansas City, MO. A typical day for me usually involves a combination of playing, teaching and writing music. My mornings are used for listening, practicing and covering business things while in the afternoon and evening I’m either out performing or teaching at Music House School of Music. I also accompany KC Ballet’s R.O.A.D. program in multiple elementary schools throughout the week and help teach Unity’s Youth Meditation on Sundays. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/197485786&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Delve a little into your own process of songwriting. What may surprise a listener of your music about how you create it? What tools do you use?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Within my own process of songwriting, I start with the music side of things. Brainstorming for ideas involves a lot playing around, trying things out and following my ear/intuition. If I find myself staring at a “blank slate” for too long, I try to come up with ideas by checking out a chord progression or melody that sticks out to me. Then I see if I can vary or connect it to another concrete idea I have. After I’ve established a general song form or at least a section to work I begin to work on lyrics. If I feel stuck or unmotivated lyrically, I like to study other writer’s songs or read a short story to stimulate my imagination. I try to keep ideas on reserve, both musically and lyrically, so when it’s time to write the first step isn’t so intimidating. Discovering these initial ideas tends to be the most tedious part of the process. Nothing I usually write comes in a clean, step-wise order. For example, my last couple of songs were written in sections. Sometimes I find my first, initial idea might work better as an ending or vice versa. Trying to figure out how the puzzle is all pieced together is my favorite part of the songwriting process. I think it's because at that point the song has established some form yet it has many directions in which it can go! </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/ubhN8D85J54?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Your website states that your original work aims to ""combine jazz with the narrative elements of contemporary folk."" Talk more about you connect these the two musical traditions in your work.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Rhythmically and harmonically, I’m heavily influenced by the jazz tradition. It’s evident in my choice of chords, groove and how my trio interacts with one another. I leave a lot of the interpretation of the feel up to the drummer and bassist within my trio. This showcases each player’s personality and allows for more individual, creative input.  When it comes to lyrics, much of my influence comes from contemporary folk artists like Joni Mitchell, Tom Waits and Rufus Wainwright. Subject matter, imagery and narrative are all things these artists explore and are masters at. Harmonically and rhythmically folk music is usually simpler than jazz and lyrics are what seem to be emphasized. To me combining these two traditions seems natural for they balance out each other. Jazz is sophisticated harmonically and rhythmically while contemporary folk is rich in lyric and narrative. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/alyssa_murray.jpg"" width=""455"" height=""683"" alt=""Alyssa Murray"" title=""Alyssa Murray"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/214736826&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What was your experience recording your first EP, <em>As of Now?</em> What did you learn that you'll bring to future recording projects?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My experience recording “As of Now” was great! Our trio had been playing most of these songs for over a year and had performed them in wide array of places. It was definitely time to record! Before heading to the studio, I thought about the larger picture and what I wanted to communicate with this particular group of songs. I decided to upgrade the arrangements of some of these tunes by adding trumpet, saxophone and guitar parts as well as some vocal harmonies.  I didn’t mess around with effects, layering or really any “studio magic”.This album was straight forward in approach and sound. Looking back, I’m starting to better understand the potential of what can be accomplished in a professional recording studio and look forward to utilizing tools such as vocal and instrumental layering, sound effects, synthesizers etc. to achieve a greater depth of sound. Thinking about the post-studio result of songs also creates a different mental space for me to write from too.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/200385461&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Can you point to one time in your life where you knew you wanted to be a composer? Who inspired you early on to create new music and what were your earliest compositions like? </strong></p><br /><br /><p>I have some early memories of messing around on pianos and making up songs in my head but it wasn’t until I began guitar lessons at age 12 that my creative spark was lit. I felt an immediate sense that I should be aiming to create something but didn’t know exactly what. I started carrying around notebooks and filling them up with writings, song ideas and a lot of random doodles. Listening and discovering new music became a favorite activity of mine.  It wasn’t until I was 16 that I completed my first song but shortly after that I started writing regularly. Luckily, I had a great songwriting mentor that helped guide me in my own writing and introduced me to many great songwriters, authors and poets. Lessons with him created an environment that inspired me to write and cultivate my own ideas. I feel my earlier compositions share the originality of my current songs posses but are less sophisticated harmonically and rhythmically. That shift in my style can be credited to playing and studying jazz the past five years or so. My earlier lyrics were more abstract while now there tends to be more cohesive story lines. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/198932419&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What advice do you have for younger composers?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Some advice I’d give to young composers is to be aware of your strengths and weaknesses. Be honest about what makes you unique and use that to your advantage. Let that aspect empower yourself and your art. Yet, be open minded that there’s much to explore and an infinite number of ways to improve and evolve. </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Who or what inspires you now?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I’m digging deeper into the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim and other Brazilian musicians like Baden Powell and Joao Gilberto.  I’m also revisiting Kenny Werner’s ‘Effortless Mastery’, a great book discussing the ideal mental space for playing and practicing and how to cultivate that space with meditation. </p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Alyssa Murray's recommendations from the Johnson County Catalog: </strong></p><br /><br /><p>1. <strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/366635036_effortless_mastery"">Effortless Mastery</a></em> by Kenny Werner </strong></p><br /><br /><p>2. <strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1011620036_sonny_rollins"">Saxophone Colossus</a></em> by Sonny Rollins</strong> </p><br /><br /><p>3. <strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1011620036_sonny_rollins"">Interpreter of Maladies</a></em> by Jhumpa Lahiri </strong></p><br /><br /><p>4. <strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/319131036_rufus_wainwright"">Rufus Wainwright</a></em> by Rufus Wainwright</strong></p><br /><br /><p>5. <strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/336802036_the_hissing_of_summer_lawns"">The Hissing of Summer Lawns</a></em> by Joni Mitchell </strong></p><br /><br /><p>6. <strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1011658036_elis_amp_tom"">Elis and Tom</a></em> by Antonio Carlos Jobim </strong></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1444668853","1484770492","0","0","Singer - Songwriter|Jazz","jazz","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/alyssa-murray-am-trio","http://www.alyssamurraymusic.com/","Learn more about the AM Trio here."

A mainstay on the Kansas City music scene until recently, Rae's music is notable for its range, originality and unpredictability. Her first album, 2011's <em>Plays Tiny </em><em>Instruments, </em>showed that her love of ukuleles, toy pianos, kazoos and mini harmonicas was more about creative expression and good songs than mere novelty. Since then she has continued to grow as a songwriter, singer and performer, taking three years to work on songs for her (apparently tiny instrument-free) upcoming album, <em>Girlfriends and Ghosts. </em>Rae has been kind enough to share a mix of her new song ""<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/johnson-county-library/i-am-a-house_mix_no_vocaldelay"">I Am A House</a>"" exclusively with Listen Local. Enjoy!</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>How long have you been a  songwriter? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong><br /><br /><br />	I’ve been writing songs since I can remember. Some of my earliest memories are centered around making music: humming along to Elvis when I could not yet speak, tapping out melodies on a piano as a toddler, singing silly lyrics on our back yard swing set.  In middle school, my Ma used to find lyrics crumpled up and thrown into my trash. I didn’t start writing songs so that they could be performed until five years ago, though.</p><br /><br /><p><br /><br />	My days right now are totally focused on finishing recording. I’ve been working out of this little room in the basement all summer and have logged something like two hundred plus hours experimenting and recording. I had never touched recording software before this. I didn’t even know what MIDI meant. WHAT? I know, I know. So, I spend my days learning, and when I need a mental escape from recording, I go on hikes, read, drink coffee, dance, and then it’s right back to music land!</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/227002916&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/226656429&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Talk about what you’ve been up since your last solo album, 2011’s <em>Plays Tiny Instruments. </em>What can listeners expect from your upcoming album, <em>Girlfriends and Ghosts</em>?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I’ve moved around quite a bit, staying in Kansas City for the longest stint. I was in a band called Rooms Without Windows.  We played a ton of shows in the KC/Lawrence area, and released two singles and an EP in 2014. For personal reasons, I left Kansas City and have since been going between Omaha, NE and my hometown of Sioux Falls, SD. I’ve been writing the songs for <em>Girlfriends and Ghosts</em> over the course of three years.</p><br /><br /><p>This album is very personal to me, a vulnerable account of past relationships and the ways in which I’ve shifted because of them. As far as sound, it’s going to be very different from <em>Plays Tiny Instruments. </em>You won’t hear any small friends on this one! The tracks are guitar heavy: some clean and some crunchy. It’s 1940’s Blues meets 1950’s Doo Wop meets 1980’s Brit Punk meets early 2000s Pop Rock. I’ve been so inspired by so many different styles of music, and I wanted to try my hand at merging a few of them.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/0ThBaWOUm14?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Tell us about your fondness for the sound of an out-of-tune or “imperfect” piano.   What do you appreciate most about this sound and how does it inspire you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>This is my favorite question.</p><br /><br /><p>I like anything that’s a little off in music, whether it’s the tuning or the tempo or even the musician. For me, there are no specific rules to how music should sound. I’m more interested in the feeling those sounds can give someone. An old out of tune piano, for instance, makes you feel something unexpected. Maybe you assume that the next note is going to be a full step up, and instead only makes it ¾ of the way. Now, the note is not quite major nor is it minor. In that moment, when you can’t quite mentally compartmentalize even a single note, you kind of question everything, because you’re so thrown. There’s a little jump or prick in your heart that you didn’t expect to feel. That is what I love about an instrument intentionally left out of tune. It pushes you outside of the box in which you thought you’d be able to stay.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/60887610&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/156183972&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Can you point to one time in your life where you knew you wanted to be a songwriter? Who inspired you early on to write music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>It clicked in college. With a certain amount of encouragement, I realized it could be more than just a hobby for me. Ha, uh, I’ve also got this vivid memory of a younger me sitting on a swing set rewriting the lyrics of “Hey Jude” to “Hey Food”, a satirical account about getting sad when your produce rots. Maybe in that moment little me decided she loved to write songs.</p><br /><br /><p>As far as early inspirations, I have three answers: ELVIS PRESLEY, PATSY CLINE, AND MY PARENTS. My Grandma was a huge fan of Elvis; she passed the love unto my mother, who passed it on to me. We used to have an “Elvis shrine” in our basement, big ceramic heads of him and velvet paintings. My mom would sing me Patsy songs when I tried to sleep. She bought me band and orchestra instruments. Put me through piano lessons with this awful Russian lady. And I wouldn’t own a single guitar if it weren’t for my dad. I owe them the world because they helped me build mine.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/8wT2vAUxYoE?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your creative process.  What tools do you use?  How does collaboration figure into this process? </strong></p><br /><br /><p>I write a lot of songs while walking, usually at night, always by myself. The cadence of the feet and stillness of the air usually puts a melody in my head. When one does come to me, I capture a crappy recording of it onto my phone so I don’t forget. Typically, if I don’t work on the idea directly after it happens, it becomes stockpiled. I think I have something like 125 song ideas saved in my phone right now just waiting to come to life. Some of my best songs happen through stream of consciousness. No thought, just plug in and play.</p><br /><br /><p>I don’t know much music theory, so it’s always seemed intimidating to collaborate with other musicians. If they were to  say, “Go to an F Sharp Minor”, I would just freeze, because I have no idea where that exists on a fretboard! I probably play the damn chord all the time, but I can’t for the life of me get theory to stay in my brain. It was easier in Rooms Without Windows, because I was just singing.</p><br /><br /><p>I recently realized that I wasn’t doing myself any favors by staying in this fear state, though, especially since creating and producing music is everything to me! So I sucked it up and just starting jamming with people. Sometimes it crashes and burns, and that’s okay, because at least we tried! Other times, a total symbiotic dynamic happens, and that is the best outcome for which I could ever hope; that I could inspire someone as much as they inspire me. I recently met a person who is just that, and we have a new project called GORDO JI’BANG. It’s totally expanding my musical horizons and allowing me to be more creative than I ever have been before.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/133272565&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Who or what currently inspires you?</strong><br /><br /><br />	I am inspired by people who ask questions and aren’t afraid to express themselves truthfully, despite what others may think of them. I’ve always been cautious not to step on toes, so when I meet someone who fully speaks their mind, I find myself in a state of admiration. I am inspired by silence and by wind, as well as anything that produces a percussive beat, whether it’s windshield wipers on a car, or the sound of foot steps. I’m inspired any time I travel, which I make a point to do often. I think living somewhere, working somewhere, you get into a rhythm, which isn’t inherently bad; but, stepping outside of your normal reminds you that there are so many separate existences in the world and so many different ways to be. I learn something new about myself every time I travel. Gosh, I could talk forever about what else inspires me. I think I find a new one every day.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Kindt%2C+Matt%22&search_category=author&t=author""><em>MIND MGMT</em> series</a> by Matt Kindt</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1137191036_the_death-ray"">The Death Ray</a></em> by Daniel Clowes</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/482647036_blankets"">Blankets</a></em> by Craig Thompson</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/287804036_jitterbug_perfume"">Jitterbug Perfume</a></em> by Tom Robbins</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/287804036_jitterbug_perfume"">The Master and Margarita</a></em> by Mikhail Bulgakov</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1350397036_the_complete_cosmicomics"">Cosmicomics</a></em> by Italo Calvino</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/77733036_nausea"">Nausea</a></em> by Jean Paul Sartre</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/933875036_the_death_of_bunny_munro""><em>Death of Bunny Monro</em></a> by Nick Cave</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/390515036_brmc"">B.R.M.C.</a> by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1234656036_push_the_sky_away"">Push The Sky Away</a>  by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1338607036_rol%C3%AA"">Role (New Sounds of Brazil)</a> </strong></em><strong>by Various Artists</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/640390036_i_am_not_afraid_of_you_and_i_will_beat_your_ass"">I Am Not Afraid Of You And I Will Beat Your Ass</a> by Yo La Tengo</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/831546036_let_it_be"">Let It Be</a> by The Replacements </strong></p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1444085653","1484770567","0","0","Singer - Songwriter|Rock|Pop","singer-songwriter|pop|rock","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/elsa-rae","https://soundcloud.com/elsaplaystinyinstruments","Hear more of Elsa's music here."

Comprised of band leader Joshua Williams, drummer Perry Holliday II, keyboardist Desmond Mason, and vocalists Venessa Ayala, Debo'ra Baskin and Derick Cunigan, Shades of Jade's sound is rooted in jazz improvisation with hip-hop and fusion elements and a healthy dose of musical risk-taking. Their recently released debut album, <a href=""http://shadesofjadekc.bandcamp.com/album/fingerprinted-memories-pt-i""><em>Fingerprinted Memories, Pt. 1</em></a> is being heralded as ""contemporary improvisational music that transcends boundaries and shatters genres."" Enjoy our interview with members of the band and hear some of the music they've shared with Listen Local.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourselves. How did Shades of Jade come to be?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>xJ-Will:</strong> My name is Joshua Williams, my friends call me xJ-Will. I am from St Louis, Mo and I am the Founder and Creator of the Eclectic band Shades of Jade. The band got its start while Desmond “The Professor"" Mason, Tyree Johnson and Dominique Sanders were all in college about 5 years back at UMKC. While I was enrolled in the conservatory with Dominique Sanders we both were starting to feel the monotony of learning 50-60 year old jazz and Broadway songs that we enjoyed but couldn't’t really fully relate to as much as we wanted. We started to think about how the musicians of that time period weren’t playing songs from 50 years before them so why should we?! They were playing their own music and popular music of the day which became standards that stood the test of time later after they had passed. That's what we wanted to do! Write our own music, develop our own individual sound, and paint “musical pictures"" of our millennial time period through our eyes.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/214538145&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p>The music that we were playing in school was great don’t get me wrong but our creative thirst was being held hostage in all the work we had to focus on in school. So we put this project together. In it, EVERYBODY WRITES and takes risks PERIOD! Those are the only rules really about the band. We started as a quartet, and experimented with different meters of time, compositional forms of songs, and had a ton of guest artists from different cites like Chicago, Houston, New York, and St Louis come in and do a week residency with the band to create and express ourselves aurally as much as we could. It wasn’t until recently this year that the band decided as a group to introduce regular vocalists into the band and it has been very exciting to start to write original lyrics for the group as well. So I guess to answer the question Shades started as a bunch of guys that wanted to jam and improvise on tunes by Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, and OutKast without being looked at as being weird in the institutional curriculum of the collegiate jazz community. So we made our own platform to do it instead.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Desmond:</strong> Yeah, I concur with all that xJ-Will said. For my side of the story, please refer to <a href=""http://www.jocolibrary.org/we-recommend/listen-local/featured-artist-desmond-mason"">my individual Local Listen interview</a> that I did with the JOCO Library! ☺</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/thI0F99HNvQ?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Derick Cunigan:</strong> For me it’s a little different. I met Desmond back in May of 2014….Eddie Moore was supposed to do a gig for me and had sent Desmond as his replacement. I was super nervous I had never heard of Desmond and this was my first stepping out on my own gig. It was the best decision Eddie ever made lol. Now I think on every track that Des and I collaborate on there should be a quick snippet that says “Shoutout to Eddie” because I’m not sure how else I would have gotten connected to the group. From there it was just organic… nothing was planned it just happened and felt natural. I think that kind of chemistry is the best. I think everyone has been welcoming even as an honorary member and always pushing the music.…..It’s definitely a good time creating with the group.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Perry Holliday:</strong> My Name is Perry Holliday or Perry DJ Stix Holliday as I am regularly referred to. I am the drummer and one of the Co-owners of the band Shades of Jade. I am from Kansas City and have been playing drums for about 23 of the 25 years of my life. I studied jazz at the University of Missouri – Kansas City Conservatory of Music and Dance. I am an alumni of Wyandotte High School in Kansas City, KS. For me, Shades came to be through me searching for an outlet. I’ve known Josh and Desmond since College and have played with them in different settings. None of those settings can even compare to what we have experienced these last few years that I have been with Shades.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/177840501&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/218842518&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Shades of Jade’s music is grounded in improvisation. Delve a little into the creative drive behind crafting compositions for your new album, <em>Fingerprinted Memories, Pt. 1</em>, while keeping the energy of improvisation at the forefront.</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>xJ-Will:</strong> We really wanted to find the best way to express ourselves, our emotions and our various circumstances of life with<em>Fingerprinted</em><em> Memories</em> series. So improvisation was actually really easy to continue to keep as the underlying energy of the album, because life brings up new challenges every day that we can’t predict, and so if you want to make it to tomorrow, you have to roll with the punches and be able to adapt on your feet. So when we went into the studio there was no sheet music for the tunes we planned on recording, just life concepts that we agreed upon. That way everyone had enough mental/creative space to add their piece to each track of how they interpret the song/memory/emotion.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/UvomFiFF39M?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Desmond:</strong> When I’ve created and finished compositions for our debut album and the album we are working on now, I think that ease of improvisation, or most importantly ease of expression, really informed the way I finished those tunes. In other words, while composing for a project like this and while composing “jazz” in general, I think of my tunes as not only aural pictures of life’s experiences and/or important people, I think of my tunes as vehicles of improvisation and facilitators of musical conversation. So while I have my past, present, and future in mind while composing, I also think about whether or not a vocalist or instrumentalist can use the tune that I am writing to “speak” to the audience or even to themselves in their own way.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Perry Holliday:</strong> I can’t talk much about the first album as I wasn’t on that recording but I can speak to the overall creative drive of this group. This is a place where you can express yourself and make music in a way that has no bounds. Our goal is to create a product with our lives, that our listener can connect to and join. It’s like outer space travel only you don’t have to be an astronaut to fly; all you have to do is be open to time and space. The emotion, mixed with the soul, kindred spirit, and hunger of this group is electrifying. And these are the factors that keep me around.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p>(continued in <a href=""http://jocolibrary.org/we-recommend/listen-local/featured-artist-shades-jade-part-two"">Part Two</a>)</p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1441979655","1484772975","0","0","R and B - Soul|Eclectic|Jazz|Hip-hop - Rap","jazz|improvisation|hip-hop|fusion","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/shades-jade","https://soundcloud.com/shadesofjademusic/immabethatone/s-b3gJy","Listen to Shades of Jade's newest single, ""That One Mastered Copy"" here."

We recently relocated to Prairie Village, KS, and it’s lovely here, but with long histories of living in Kansas City, Missouri, we tend to identify ourselves as being from KCMO. We are full-time musicians and work in the metro area, and all over the country, playing concerts, festivals, and teaching at music camps. Both of us, in our former bands, continuously did our part to help people understand there are two Kansas Cities… it’s amazing how many people still don’t understand that!</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/147424334&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/147424314&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Tell us about your recently released Bird Notes EP. Where was it recorded? What did you learn from this experience that you’ll take to future recording projects?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>We formed our duo in late 2014. By early 2015, we already had many opportunities to travel and perform, and every touring band needs an album for their fans. So, we needed to get something recorded, and fast. We made “Bird Notes” at home; Clarke has years of experience engineering and producing recordings and we enjoyed the opportunity to explore sounds in our new space. Every time a musician records, hopefully there are many lessons in the experience.</p><br /><br /><p>Here are a few of our lessons. Our home needed more acoustic treatments for future recordings, which we have now done. Mostly it’s about getting rid of hard angles and smooth surfaces; well really, it’s about a lot more than that, like microphone placement and proximity, ceiling height and flooring… maybe even sock color. Clarke is so knowledgeable about room acoustics, and how microphones capture sound, and how to place them properly and how certain mics work better with certain instruments. Lucky me. I just situate myself where he tells me to, and do my best to play my fiddle with all my heart and to sing truthfully and in tune. Oh, lessons. We learned more about how we work together in a recording scenario. We also got a great reminder about making music that we enjoy, that challenges us and frees us, and not overthinking what we imagine others might want or expect of us. This, I believe, is one of the most important lessons in our pursuit of this aspect of our creativity.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/147424294&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/83893431&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your creative process with songwriting, especially in light of your musical partnership and the traditional grounding of your music. What songs are you most proud of?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>We do love to create music; our current primary focus is to study and celebrate traditional music of the southern mountain states. So first, we learn a tune or a song, going deeply into the process of study - early recorded sources, any history or perspective on the provenance and family of the piece (both human and cultural)… where the music comes from is part of what makes it sound the way it does. Some pieces give us the opportunity to learn a new technique element. Others require a diligent subtle touch. Each tune or song is a treasure and it’s our calling to explore it and see how it relates to us. Our one-liner is “Adventures in Music”, and so sometimes a tune may allow for a creative infusion, either in the form of improvisation, or a new section that we may compose, or a lyrical treatment. Other tunes or songs may need to be nested carefully in a very simple setting so that they can be appreciated for the natural beauty they possess. It’s truly an honor to learn these beautiful pieces that have been passed down in the generations, through time, place, and setting. I began playing the violin 40 years ago; this ongoing study has taken me to a multitude of inner landscapes (and physical places). Each chapter of my musical life has meaning. Finding old time music more than 20 years ago set me on a path that continues to bring illumination and challenge. That’s maybe not the same as pride but it’s meaningful.</p><br /><br /><p>Oh, and we love to compose; these things come in phases for us and we both think melody and harmony and rhythm before words. I’ve written a handful of songs, but lately it’s been about melody for me; instrumental music is its own language and I almost constantly have melody in my mind’s ear. I know that Clarke is this way as well. He’s always humming or singing, except when he has a banjo in his hands, which is much of the time. His dedication to growing his already considerable musical landscape is inspiring.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/j6jZf_hGU6w?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Tell us about the fellowship you received through Artist, INC. What has this fellowship enabled you to accomplish?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>We each applied for and were accepted into the Artist, INC program, spring 2015. It was both perfect timing and a perfect storm, coming at the same time that we were newly developing our duo, and discovering what this next chapter of our lives looked like. It was a great and challenging time to be in the program. We worked on our writing and communication skills, and broadened our understanding of professionalism in the arts. Working towards some of our goals in tandem with other artists, we felt more like part of a community as opposed to working secluded on our duo at home. The Artist, INC program helped us to be more clear with our goals and to think through the steps needed to achieve them. We are continuing the work we started when we went through the program. I think we’ll continue to learn more about ourselves as we keep doing the work that it takes every day to be working artists.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/l_CK8OB9hBQ?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you the most about the Kansas City music scene?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I love that we have so many different styles of musicians here. Looking at the heritage of jazz and blues represented by older masters — not to mention the ones already passed on — and young preservationists, to a seriously committed rock and punk rock scene, and resurgence of country music over the last fifteen years or so, and ongoing strong songwriters older and younger, not to mention experimental music a-plenty, and an ever-strengthening folk scene largely in thanks to Folk Alliance International moving here… and then the classical and arts music abounding as it has for so long… looking at all this and then whatever else pops up on the horizon, I’m impressed by our city and region’s talent and conviction. I’ve had a foot in several of these communities during my now 30-year residence in Kansas City… and even now I plant myself in the midst of a variety of collaborations as opportunities and time allow. It’s also exciting that KC hosts concerts by many amazing touring artists thanks to venues and audiences supportive of such a variety. Here’s the thing. A music (or art, or theatre, or any creative endeavor) scene takes at least four components to thrive. Artists. Venues. Media. Audiences. I believe we have that, and I also believe we can do more to gain more traction with audiences. I want to be a part of the process and maybe encourage regular “think tank” gatherings to look at how the creative artists in Kansas City can be creative in getting the word out to larger audiences, by working in new ways with venues, media, fans, and each other.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/-RqJy_YeApA?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Betse’s recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Books:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/229794036_the_big_rock_candy_mountain"">The Big Rock Candy Mountain</a></strong></em> by Wallace Stegner</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/314882036_a_good-natured_riot"">A Good-natured Riot: The Birth Of The Grand Ole </a><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/314882036_a_good-natured_riot"">Opry</a></strong></em> by Charles K.

Their recently released debut album, <a href=""http://shadesofjadekc.bandcamp.com/album/fingerprinted-memories-pt-i""><em>Fingerprinted Memories, Pt. 1</em></a> is being heralded as ""contemporary improvisational music that transcends boundaries and shatters genres.""

Our next project, <em>Fingerprinted Memories Pt 2 Sketches of the Heart</em>, is definitely getting more time and energy into each single track for production. We learned from the last album that we have a potential that forces us to set the bar a lot higher for ourselves. FPTM Pt. 1 had a HUGE learning curve because up until that point, most of us had never all been involved with the process of recording, mixing, and producing our own material. Part 2 will be more of a “themed experience"" project instead of just a few friends playing their instruments at the same time with a common ideal. Even from the single that we just released from the project this past month “That One” sounds completely different than what we did about a year ago now and we definitely liked it! The ideal for the project will stay the same: Life is lived forwards but is only understood backwards, and in the constant search of our personal identity FPM focuses on the individual “history” of past experiences, adventures, and background in order to define who we are and to embed our true fingerprint into the world. Oh and we also learned that when in the studio, turn Perry DjStix Holliday's (the drummer) levels in your headphones off because he is always got a hilarious random tidbit of information that was not necessary at all lol.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Desmond</strong>: The recording of our first album, as xJ-Will alluded to, went by REALLY fast. We did a couple of takes of each tune and went with the best takes, which is standard operating procedure for an instrumental jazz album with really no added effects or overdubbing, etc. (well, maybe there was some patching here or there, but not much from what I heard). I also remember that I was nervous as all-get-out during the session, because it was Shades’ debut album! I wanted my playing to be as perfect as possible. Now as far as what I’m taking from that session into the sessions for FPM pt. 2? The biggest thing is the actual studio experience, as I am not as nervous in those situations anymore and I know almost exactly what I want to contribute to the music before most studio sessions. Yet, FPM pt. 2 has been a huge undertaking in itself. Since SOJ is delving more into a fusion of genres (R&B, Jazz, Neo-Soul, Hip-Hop, etc.), we’ve had to learn more about recording those genres of music. Recording vocals, as we have found out, is way more time consuming than just recording instrumentals, for example.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/Aznn56r3rXo?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p>We’ve also had to learn even more about how to be a contribution to the whole product rather than being the show. When playing jazz, each member has a chance to be “the show” at one time or the other. When recording things with vocals though, I know I as a pianist/organist/keyboardist/etc. that I have to be cognizant of every little thing that I play so I make a viable contribution that adds to the song yet doesn’t TAKE AWAY from the song. And yeah, I most definitely turn djstix down in the studio. He’s an awesome drummer but is as loud as a Rolling Stones concert (and I’ve never been to one). He’s most definitely the Elvin Jones of Kansas City drummers. I turn myself up though, I always like what I’m doing (I kid, I kid!).</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Derick Cunigan</strong>: I can’t speak to writing on Part 1 but in “That One” I think moving forward everything will now be held to a bar. Like I don’t even want to go to the studio if my part isn’t solid or I at least don’t have a strong idea for the song just because it can take so much time and it can feel like a waste of time for others who may just be listening in the studio. For me I that “That One” was just a tip of the iceberg for me vocally, lyrically and just overall emotion of how I want you to feel when you listen to the music. I think Part 2 has a great theme and for me just fits right up my alley.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Perry Holliday:</strong> For Part 2, I want to make sure that we capture the essence of this group. People love our live shows, and while we can not totally reproduce live in the studio, I think we can do a great job giving our listener enough to want to come out and be apart of the live experience without leaving them unsatisfied.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/O2UVWF2Ku7c?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What are your biggest creative challenges as a quintet? How do you move beyond creative blocks?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>xJ-Will:</strong> Biggest challenge? Getting 5-7 people in one room at the same time to produce new music into a complete production seems to be more of the wall to climb rather than creativity. The group is full of creative people that can really channel and churn out new art pretty consistently at the drop of a hat when we are in rehearsal and collectively adding to a song. For me personally when I have creative blocks, instead of being frustrated I just step away from that specific work for a bit until that inspiration comes back to complete it or try to compose in a different space. I am a firm believer that the most genuine songs have a direct purpose based off of experiences people can relate to, so if I have hit a wall, its because I either haven’t finished living through what I’m trying to express or haven’t fully understood it yet.</p><br /><br /><p>To try and prevent creative blocks before they start I try a couple of different things. I always listen to new music to keep my ears fresh, attempt to write on different instruments, and I also challenge myself to work in a limiting scenario (i.e. melody must have certain requirements like a specific rhythm, in a specific key or time signature, or odd form etc)</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Desmond</strong>: I agree with xJ-Will that the most challenging creative block as far as songwriting as a group is actually getting the group together. Each and every one of us do very different things outside of the band, with djstix owning an entertainment business in his own right! It is most definitely a challenge to get 5-7 minds in one room at a time. Another creative block that we run into from time to time is that we all are influenced by different music. When these influences mesh together it is a beautiful thing, yet sometimes when creating we can be on separate pages too. These things usually work themselves out in the end, however, as the members of the band have generally good chemistry and camaraderie.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Perry Holliday:</strong> The Biggest challenges we face right now are synergy. Having made some amazing additions to the group very recently, We are working to create that same Synergy with our new vocalists that Josh, Desmond, and I share. By the way the vocalists are doing an incredible job with meshing with the style of this band.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/NDYtK7zbdnU?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What’s the best thing about living, working and performing jazz in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>xJ-Will:</strong> The best thing about living and working in Kansas City is the energy that fuels the artists here. I really wish I knew where it came from. Many artists here are very self driven Whether it's the First Friday events in the crossroads district, the multiple art fairs, or how there is some form of music being played every day of the week in local venues thats what i really enjoy about Kansas City.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Desmond:</strong> The best thing about living, working, and performing in KC is the cost of living. I’m just being honest with you. I don’t think we could be experimenting like we are in places such as LA or NY for example: the pressure to actually make a living would be too high. That’s my two cents on that. The musicians are the second best thing about living, working, and performing in KC. I haven’t met a generally mean or grouchy person among local musicians. They are all generally nice, wouldn’t mind jamming with you or teaching you a few things, and generally have each other’s backs when situations that affect the whole music scene arise. That’s the impression that I have thus far.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Derick Cunigan</strong>: What I have seen from Kansas City in my short 8-9 years is that there is so much talent and I think people want to come out and support but you just have to give them a reason. I kind of saw this first hand with my Soul Revival project. I have to add also the pool of musicians that live here is pretty cool and for the most part my experiences with everyone that I have had the chance to work with has been good.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Perry Holliday</strong>: Kansas city is a major hub of creativity and uniqueness. Jazz is not a lost art form. It wasn’t created and innovated to stop in the 60’s. Everything we do can still be referenced to Jazz because it innovates the unthinkable. It calls on creativity that has not yet been explored. It requires risk and faith. Which is what this group, and Kansas City Jazz since its inception are built on.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Learn more about the long history of jazz in Kansas City:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/544205036_kansas_city_jazz"">Kansas City Jazz: From Ragtime to Bebop : A History</a></strong> by Frank Driggs</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1266338036_kansas_city_lightning"">Kansas City Lightning: The Rise and Times of Charlie Parker</a></strong> by Stanley Crouch</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/884256036_kansas_city_jazz"">​Kansas City Jazz (DVD)</a></strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1204652036_kansas_city_jazz_amp_blues"">Kansas City Jazz & Blues: Past, Present & Future</a></strong> (DVD)</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1441990455","1484772887","0","0","R and B - Soul|Eclectic|Jazz|Hip-hop - Rap","jazz|improvisation|hip-hop|fusion","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/shades-jade-part-two","http://shadesofjademusic.com/","Visit Shades of Jade's website for more music, inspiration and information."

Ruskowitz's most recent album, <em>Points on the Pieces, </em>echoes the work of power pop luminaries Marshall Crenshaw, Game Theory and Aimee Mann's early solo work, and making it all sound effortless in the process. In this interview, Ruskowitz discusses his ""haphazard"" songwriting process and how unforeseen circumstances affected the sound of <em>Points on the Pieces. </em>We are fortunate to welcome Adam Ruskowitz to Listen Local.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourself. Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Adam Ruskowitz. I live in KCK and work in Shawnee, KS. I have a grown-up job to support my music habit, but writing, recording, and performing will always be an important part of my life.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Tell us about your third album, <em>Points on the Pieces.</em> Where was it recorded? Who else plays on it?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em>Points on the Pieces</em> started out as a simple solo acoustic EP. It had been over 6 years since I had put out <em>Boxed Wine & Bottle Rockets</em>, and there were three or four new songs that I felt were ready. I decided to try something I hadn’t done before; record stripped-down style, with only acoustic guitar and vocals.</p><br /><br /><p>Unbeknownst to me, the studio where I’d done my previous two albums had shut down. The owner had left the music industry to focus on running a boxing gym for the youth of Kansas City. (Or to phrase it another way, faced with the prospect of enduring the recording process with me for a third time, his preference was to be punched in the face repeatedly by a bunch of angry kids).</p><br /><br /><p>I had to do some research to find a new studio, which allowed time for my modest and unassuming acoustic EP to spiral out of control into entire album, complete with full instrumentation and an overarching lyrical narrative.</p><br /><br /><p>I eventually decided on Element Recording in Kansas City, MO. I did all of the guitars and vocals, while studio engineer Adam McGill (formerly of the Republic Tigers) handled percussion, bass, keys, etc. He’s a pop-music savant, and helped me take the songs to levels that just wouldn’t have been possible on my own. After we had everything recorded, studio owner Joel Nanos headed up the mixing and mastering process. Joel brought a lot of unique ideas to the table. The sound of this album was skewing poppier than anything I’d ever done before, and Joel’s instincts allowed us to maintain somewhat of an indie veneer to everything.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196195507&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your creative process with songwriting and recording. What tools do you use? What may surprise people about how your music is created?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My process is haphazard. I’ve never been able to sit down with the sole intent of writing music. It typically happens organically, with an intriguing lyric or melody that pops into my head. I’ll record snippets of ideas with an acoustic guitar, and then flesh them out over time with full lyrics and additional instrumentation, using a four-track recorder app on my phone.</p><br /><br /><p>The most surprising part for me is always how much a song can change from inception to finished product. I think it’s really important as a songwriter not to become too devoted or married to an idea. If you write a really clever or poignant lyric, the temptation is to show it off by making it part of the hook or refrain. But sometimes it’s better served elsewhere. When I was writing Points on the Pieces, I had written this line that I thought was kind of cool: “<em>I told you that I blacked out, but that was a white lie.” </em>I wanted to develop an entire song around that theme, using that lyric as the chorus. I finished the song, but it just wasn’t clicking in the way that I had hoped. The song was scrapped, and that particular line eventually wound up in the bridge of a song called “Baby Maybe.” I only sing the line once, and you could even say that it’s buried away. But used sparingly, it was far more effective.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196201820&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What most excites you about music and creativity in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Local music is thriving, and my favorite part of that is that it’s not limited to any particular genre.

Lovingly orchestrated and produced, with an emphasis on hushed melodies and inventive arrangements that recall everything from Wilco in their quieter moments to 1970s influences like Todd Rundgren and even Pink Floyd at their most pastoral, Carswell and Hope are cultivators of the timeless sounds of pop. We are extremely lucky to share an interview the band's lyricist, singer and guitarist Nick Carswell about the band and his creative process, as well as his book, music and movie recommendations.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I'm Nick Carswell, lead singer and guitarist with Carswell & Hope. I also play bass with the band Pink Royal, run an independent music collective called Silly Goose Records, and work for KU Audio Reader in Lawrence<strong>. </strong>Though I now live in Lawrence, I'm originally from Ireland<strong>.</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Describe your creative process with songwriting, especially in light of your work with both Carswell and Hope and the Elective Orchestra. What songs are you most proud of?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My creative process is usually slow and quite long. I like to have many ideas of melodies, chord progressions or lyrics stewing over months or sometimes years before I tease it into a song or a piece of music. In some ways it's like having a 'back-catalog' (as I call it) that I can dip into, whenever I want to explore or revisit a 'new' idea. In another way, it's like keeping a little garden of ideas or melodies well-watered and watching for what might flourish, and when. Then, giving it the appropriate attention to help it blossom.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/34603217&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Tell us about a song that you really struggled to get right. How did you break through the creative block?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The Long Goodbye of the Profiteer, the closing track on <em><a href=""https://carswellandhope.bandcamp.com/album/a-hunger"">A Hunger</a></em> took a long time to come together, lyrically. The song is about the greed of property developers, bankers and others who did such damage to the economy and to so many people's lives in the economic crash, particularly in Ireland. And it's more about the feelings that it created for those people who were cheated and whose futures were really destroyed by the selfish actions of a few. The song plays like the end of a jilted love affair, which is probably an apt sentiment, but I wanted to convey that more precise meaning too. In the end, my approach was the same: just give it a little more time. Let the ideas, the melody and eventually the mood of the recording filter through until the lyrics and tone felt right. Arguably, those things are what really create the meaning for the listener - moreso than any single troublesome lyric. So, a little time, a little more attention, and trusting that something would emerge was my approach.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What have you learned from your recent recording experiences that you'll take to future ones?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The nicest thing about recording your own music [both Jason Slote (drums) and myself are experienced engineers/producers] is the freedom to experiment with processes. For example, in contrast to The Long Goodbye, the final song we added to that record was 'Song for Today', which we wrote, recorded and mixed in maybe 2-3 studio sessions. We even added one last electronic element after the track came back from the mastering engineer, so that was literally the last thing we did on the entire album (which took the guts of 2 years to make). It's pretty liberating to be able to give some recordings a lot more time, and to also enjoy a fresh and in some ways more exciting approach. In general, the latter is something that we might be pursuing more in future.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Can you point to one time in your life where you knew you wanted to be a songwriter? Who or what inspired you early on to create music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I discovered songwriting at the same time that I picked up the guitar, when I was 15 or 16. I had been a piano player for years, but only upon teaching myself to play guitar did the idea of crafting songs really appeal to me. It was also the same time that I discovered Neil Young, Tom Waits and others like Eric Clapton, as well as Brit pop of 1990s UK/Ireland. It was a pretty good time for songsters really, with Oasis, Blur and a few others crafting good songs that were commercially successful. I think that combination of old and new, as well as the discovery of a new instrument was inspiring, and probably influenced how I would go on to write.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What excites you the most about the Kansas City-area music scene?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Aside from the excellent pool of artists in the Kansas City region, I also find it very encouraging that there are so many diverse audiences. If you look just a little bit, you can find people who will enjoy whatever kind of music that you like to make, and people who are open to experiencing music and performance in different venues and settings. That excites me not just for the music that I am involved in now, but in imagining what kind of things we might be compelled - or encouraged - to make in the future! For an artist, that's a really good place to be.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/149185906&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Nick's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Books</strong><br /><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1406207036_between_the_world_and_me"">Between The World and Me </a></em></strong>by Ta-Nehisi Coates<br /><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/548604036_no_country_for_old_men"">No Country for Old Men</a></strong></em> by Cormac McCarthy<br /><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/603180036_the_selfish_gene"">The Selfish Gene</a> </strong></em>by Richard Dawkins</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Music</strong><br /><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1462144036_a_moon_shaped_pool"">A Moon Shaped Pool</a></strong></em> by Radiohead<br /><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1306643036_morning_phase"">Morning Phase</a></strong></em> by Beck<br /><br /><br />	Tabula Rasa, Fratres, Symphony No.3 by <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22P%C3%A4rt%2C+Arvo%22&search_category=author&t=author"">Arvo Pärt</a><br /><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/376175036_10,000_hz_legend"">10,000 Hz Legend</a></strong></em> by Air</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Film</strong><br /><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1294369036_inequality_for_all"">Inequality for All</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/866330036_encounters_at_the_end_of_the_world"">Encounters at the End of the World</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/806773036_there_will_be_blood"">There Will Be Blood</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/149381967&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1475177217","1484927085","0","0","Pop|Alternative","chamber pop","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/carswell-and-hope-0","https://carswellandhope.com/","Hear more from Carswell and Hope here."

Fans of lead singer Kianna Alarid's previous band Tilly and the Wall will find much to like in Yes You Are's expansive choruses, positive energy and imaginative production. The band have been working hard on their debut album, so we are extra fortunate and grateful to share an interview with Alarid about the band's influences and book, music and movie recommendations. Enjoy!</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>For the uninitiated, introduce the band. Where do you all live? How would you describe your music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>We are a 5 piece band straight outta KC, consisting of songwriter/rhythm guitarist/backing vocalist Jared White, guitarist/keyboardist/sound wiz/backup vocalist Jacob Temeyer, drummer Joseph Wilner, bassist Willie Jordan and myself, songwriter and lead vocalist, Kianna Alarid. If we had to muster up a plain description of our music, we might say that its alternative pop/rock.. but really, we write songs that are traditional with a capital T.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>I hear many different melodic influences in the music of Yes You Are. For example, “Echo” has unexpected traces of Beach Boys harmonies, with a melody that strangely invokes a fantasy collaboration between John Lennon and Metric, all grounded in gossamer production. Talk about some of the conscious and unconscious influences on your music.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Subconscious influence is mysterious, and its what keeps us excited to write. Lots of times, when writing songs, you don’t really know what you’re writing about until long after they’re finished. Consciously, John Lennon’s ability to lodge a melody in your head has been an influence, and Brian Wilson’s ear for music is an ideal to strive after. I mean, our biggest influence is Bob Dylan, who, on the surface, we seem nothing like, so it’s interesting how it all unfolds.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/204679754&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Speak about the music you’ve been working on for your debut album. What have been some of the unexpected challenges for the band during this process? How did you overcome them?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>We have been greatly challenged throughout the process of recording and producing this album. For us, compromising isn’t an option so when you’re talking about all of the different collaborations that come with making an album, there can be some tensions. I think the key is keeping a positive attitude, knowing your destination and believing in what you’re doing to the point of no return. Its all been a test you know? Every step of the way has held unexpected challenges for us and its all been worth it.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What do you find inspiring about the Kansas City music community?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The thing that stands out to me about the Kansas City music community is the supportiveness and the desire to share and network in a way that feels like friendship and not business. The influential people here are so brilliant and solid, and they use their platforms to bring attention to what they think is worthwhile. You can always tell when someone loves their work, because they’re doing it better than everyone else. The taste makers in this city are so good at their jobs and I respect them immensely.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/QwaeCxVNia0?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/204679610&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/503538036_chronicles,_volume_one""><em>Chronicles, Volume One</em></a> By Bob Dylan</strong></p><br /><br /><p>More importantly than telling you anything about Bob Dylan, this book can tell you who you are as well.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1237265036_valis""><em>Valis</em></a> By Philip K.

He describes his recently released ""Construction Paper"" EP as a ""build up"" to an upcoming album based on the<em>Hunger</em><em> Games</em> trilogy. The EP stands on its own, however, as a heralding of a powerful new voice in KC hip-hop. It's a pleasure to share an interview with Brotha Newz as well as his wide-ranging book, music and movie recommendations.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My full name is David Abdullah Muhammad. I'm a 31 year old African American Muslim man. I live in Shawnee, KS and teach at Shawnee Mission East HS. I also teach karate at my father's martial arts school, Integrity Martial Arts Academy, in KCMO. I have a wife, Aisha Sharif, of 7 years and a 2 year old daughter.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Delve into the making of your recent “Construction Paper” EP. Where and how was it recorded? With whom did you collaborate?</strong><br /><br /><br />	""Construction Paper"" was birthed out of necessity. I have an upcoming album releasing and I wanted to put out some free music to give people an opportunity to hear my work. It's meant to be a ""build up"" (construction) to the album. But I also wanted to touch upon the concepts of innocence and unstable foundations in society (like construction paper).<br /><br /><br />	The majority of it was recorded at ""The Depot"" with local producer Conductor Williams. However, I worked with several artists on the project. Producers: B., Signz, and Melomind (from Chicago) all pitched in beats; as well as Conductor Williams. I also collaborated with T.Lee, a Texas rapper based in Emporia. The recording process was fairly simple. I took the beats to ""Conductor"", he mixed them down, and I put my vocals over them. T.Lee emailed me his verse. I recorded the song ""Dull Pencils"" at Sam Kulikov's (Signz) home studio.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/282986108&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Your upcoming album “The Hanging Trees” is inspired by <em>The Hunger Games</em> series. What resonated with you about this series that made you want to reinterpret and respond to it?</strong><br /><br /><br />	The entire Hunger Games series really resonated with me. I felt like it was so relevant to the social issues humanity is facing now. I read all 3 books in about 2 weeks and I felt like it was jumping out of the pages. Political corruption, economic disparity, false love, divide and conquer, PTSD, time manipulation, etc. All these themes were portrayed in the series. I felt like the use of fiction was the perfect avenue to introduce these tough topics. The teacher in me felt compelled to spread the message. I started thinking about how, many kids I knew, and even adults, weren't going to be organically moved to read the novels. However, everyone listens to music. Therefore, music became the vehicle. I wanted to use music as a way to spread the message of the Hunger Games to people who weren't going to read the books or watch the films. Or to people who saw the films, but maybe didn't pick up on anything other than the romance of Katniss and Peeta.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>You are a father, teacher, martial arts instructor, social justice advocate and artist. How do you make time to produce your music with everything else you do?</strong><br /><br /><br />	I don't know where I find time! Lol. Honestly, for me, it's not about finding time, it's about finding motivation. Once I'm motivated, I'm all in! Which can sometimes be problematic. I tend to exhaust myself. But, I have an internal drive to achieve as much as possible. I don't want to waste talent or thoughts or energy. I feel like there's too much work that needs to be done. Too many messages that need to be heard. The music has simply become another avenue for my interests. It's an extension of my classroom, it's an extension of the activism I've been involved in, it's an extension of my role as a father. And it's fun! When one enjoys something, they find time for it. It's been an exhaustingly refreshing process</p><br /><br /><p><strong>What inspires you about the Kansas City-area hip-hop community?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>KC hip hop is so undervalued. There's so many talented artists in the area. And such a diverse sound. You have your staples like Tech 9ne and Rich the Factor and they should be respected. But there's a lot of great, conscious minded talent on the rise. My producer Conductor Williams is one of them, but you also have guys like: Stik Figa of Topeka (he's on my album), Barrel Maker (also on the album), MC Storm (also on the album), Les Izmore, Approach and Weave Pancho of Lawrence, Milk, Show, Mac Mo Green, Gee Watts, Reach, and so many more!</p><br /><br /><p>The KC hip hop community is a hardworking, organically built movement. It inspires me to create a product that they could hear and be proud of. We don't get a lot of notoriety in KC, but many of the artists are creating music for the love of the art. That in itself is success. Art only lives on through love.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/profile%20pic.JPG"" width=""3648"" height=""5472"" alt=""Brotha Newz the Ustadh"" title=""Brotha Newz the Ustadh"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/282986366&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Brotha Newz's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Books:</strong> <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1317817036_the_qur%C4%81n"">The Quran</a>, <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/330527036_to_kill_a_mockingbird"">To Kill A Mockingbird</a>, <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1410085036_all_american_boys"">All American Boys</a>, <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/252642036_slam"">Slam</a> (Walter Dean Myers), <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1173277036_some_of_my_best_friends_are_black"">Some of My Best Friends Are Black</a>, of course the <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=Hunger+Games+trilogy&t=series&search_category=series"">Hunger Games Trilogy</a>, <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/160481036_the_autobiography_of_malcolm_x"">The Autobiography of Malcolm X</a>, Anything by <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Zinn%2C+Howard%22&search_category=author&t=author"">Howard Zinn</a></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Music:</strong> I grew up on <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Coltrane%2C+John%22&search_category=author&t=author"">John Coltrane</a> and <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&t=author&search_category=author&q=davis%2C+miles&searchOpt=catalogue"">Miles Davis</a>. <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Jones%2C+Quincy%22&search_category=author&t=author"">Quincy Jones</a> ""Birdland"" was the soundtrack to my youth.

Hailing from Overland Park, KS, he brings a tremendous amount of fun and delightful weirdness to whatever he does. In 2014 Dave won a <a href=""http://rocketgrants.org/category/2014-projects/beep-goes-the-weasel/"">Rocket Grant</a> to bring his Beep Goes the Weasel project to the masses. For anyone interested in the intersection of pop music, science and vegetables(not to mention <a href=""http://www.rifftrax.com/"">RiffTrax</a> videos), Dave Cedillo's multimedia extravaganza is crazy entertaining. Dave is also an accomplished musician and songwriter with a knack for melody and strangely humorous lyrics. It's a pleasure to be able to share Dave's art with you on Listen Local.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about yourself. How long have you been a musician and songwriter?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My dad is a musician. He's the one who showed me the middle C on piano, and how to make chords on a guitar when I was in grade school. I was intimidated by both instruments as a child. When I was 20 or 21 I met a friend (Chris Mull) who wrote his own material, sang, and played guitar. He came over at night, and we wrote poems, found melodies, and turned them into songs. For the next 20 plus years we continued to write and play together. There is a bio on my blog that takes some liberties with the truth if you want to read more about it. During that period I also learned how to strum a guitar and sing at the same time, and play the harmonica.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>You’re involved with many different multimedIa projects. How do you balance all of your creative endeavors with work and home life?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>It can be a struggle. My wife, Jenny, has helped me get more organized over the years. She reminds me to write important dates on our wall calendar. I'll take a picture of that calendar month with my smartphone, and reference it when someone asks me if I'm available for certain dates. I also put reminders on my smartphone so I don't forget stuff. When Jenny's home I try to not to work on music because we both work regular jobs and our time together seems short at times, but if I get an idea for a song, she understands if I need to write something down or record a lyric. I usually work on creative projects in the morning before I go to work around noon. Every once in awhile I'll write or record something in the middle of the night.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/190774247&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/190769035&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How your different projects Inform each other?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Not sure what this question means... do you mean how do the projects differ from each other? I play in a semi normal church band that has a drummer, an acoustic guitarist, a mandolin/banjo player, and me. We all sing melody and harmony. I usually play rhythm on electric guitar, but sometimes I'll play something out of the ordinary like a Casio VL-tone keyboard that can fit in your pocket (it's also a calculator). This band is called Wailin’ Wall and under this name we play classic rock, bluegrass/folk, and anything else we can get our heads around. My other projects are <a href=""http://davidcedillo.com/index.php/mondo-beep/"">MONDO BEEP</a> and <a href=""http://davidcedillo.com/index.php/beep-goes-the-weasel/"">BEEP GOES THE WEASEL</a>. <a href=""http://davidcedillo.com/index.php/mondo-beep/"">MONDO BEEP</a> is synchronized chaos that started over three years ago on First Fridays. I usually start a drum sequence, and slowly add other electronic devices. <a href=""http://davidcedillo.com/index.php/beep-goes-the-weasel/"">BEEP GOES THE WEASEL</a> is less noise, more structure, and it exists to interact with individuals.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Describe your songwriting process. Who or what inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Here's a short list of people, places, things, and circumstances that have resulted in a song:<br /><br /><br />	Tom Waits, Lake Olathe, driving through foggy conditions, Elvis Costello, my morning shower, vacant lots, Lucinda Williams, Metcalf South Mall... Sometimes the rhythm of a phrase will get the song started. If it doesn't sound too much like someone else's song, I'll figure out a chord progression next. When I write lyrics, they are usually the same words I use In conversation.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Where and how do you record your music? What advice do you have for others who want to do the same?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I record everything on my desktop computer in the living room. I can plug any instrument directly into it using a line in jack. I also have a microphone to record my vocals. I use Audacity to record and mix tracks. It doesn't matter if I have an entire song or a partial song, I just record the idea whether it is all there or not. Anyone with time, patience, imagination, and a computer can do what I'm doing.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/190769824&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/190771159&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Dave's recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/550933036_at_days_close"">AT DAY'S CLOSE: NIGHT IN TIMES PAST</a> (book) - ThIs book takes the edge off insomnIa, and puts me in touch wIth my inner ancient self.</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/547172036_innocent_when_you_dream"">INNOCENT WHEN YOU DREAM</a> (book) - A collectIon of intervIews with my favorite recording and performing artist, Tom Waits.

His music is innovative, ecstatic, and award-winning, reaching such diverse ensembles as <a href=""http://www.trilliumensemble.com/"">Trillium Ensemble</a>, <a href=""http://www.musicfromchina.org/"">Music From China</a>, and many others. Steele is just as passionate about new music advocacy as he is about composing. He is a co-founder of the Kansas City-based <a href=""http://www.fuseboxnewmusic.org/"">FuseBox New Music</a><strong> </strong>composers collective, which champions new music by providing composers with commissions, performances, recordings, and collaborative opportunities, with a special focus on emerging local composers. For this edition of Listen Local, Steele shares, among others things, some insights into his creative process and his affinity for the works of Debussy and Kurt Vonnegut.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourself. Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I'm originally from Pittsburgh, PA, but now live in the Brookside neighborhood of Kansas City, MO. I am a composer, teacher, and new music advocate. Typically, I do my composing in the morning and with coffee. The coffee is a must, and I've been using the same old French press for years.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>You’re involved in many different music-related projects. Not only are you a composer, you’re a conductor, educator and “new music advocate.” Tell us about the New Music scene in and around Kansas City. Whose work are you really excited about? Where are the best venues for this music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>One of the joys of being an active, living composer is being part of a community. The notion of being locked away in a room in an Ivory Tower seems not only unappealing but inhumane. All Art reflects its origins: the artists who make it, the world they live in, the people they know. Being part of a larger community helps me to write richer music.</p><br /><br /><p>For Kansas City, the New Music scene is healthy and growing all the time. There’s a necessary diversity and each group fills an important niche.</p><br /><br /><p>My newest project is FuseBox New Music. It was co-founded a few months ago by Zane Winter, Ted King-Smith and myself. Through FuseBox, we work to promote new music by providing composers with commissions, performances, recordings, and collaborative opportunities, all with a special emphasis on emerging local composers. Our inaugural concert is October 1, at Prairie Logic downtown, which is a beautiful venue. We will be presenting a multi-composer collaborative work based around Claude Debussy’s Sonata for Flute, Viola, and Harp.</p><br /><br /><p>The longest standing professional group in Kansas City is newEar. They tend to focus on “modern classics” (an oxymoron, I know!), which are works of the past few decades that have been accepted into a new Canon of masterworks. They also play local “big names” like Jim Mobberley or Chen Yi.</p><br /><br /><p>The Blackhouse Collective was founded by Hunter Long and Russell Thorpe. They do many worthwhile projects a year from new chamber operas to workshops for composer/performers. Blackhouse performs all over the place. From art galleries to the KC ballet, they always seem to have an appealing venue.</p><br /><br /><p>KcEMA is Kansas City’s go-to organization for electronic music. In addition to their focus on local, electronic composers, they often feature guest musicians from out of town.</p><br /><br /><p>Mnemosyne Quartet is relatively new, but they’re one of the groups I’m most excited about. They are an improvisation group comprised of saxophones, bass clarinet, and electronics. Having heard them play already, I’m looking forward to their upcoming August performance at Prairie Logic.</p><br /><br /><p>Here are links to the various new music groups in KC:</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://www.fuseboxnewmusic.org/"">http://www.fuseboxnewmusic.org/</a></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://www.newear.org/"">http://www.newear.org/</a></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://blackhouse.typepad.com/"">http://blackhouse.typepad.com/</a></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://mnsquartet.wordpress.com/"">https://mnsquartet.wordpress.com/</a></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://kcema.net/"">http://kcema.net/</a></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Describe your creative process. What tools do you use?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I use a keyboard, pencil and paper, a computer, and my ears. I always consider for whom I’m writing. The instruments that I’m using play a big role in determining the music. For example, if the piece is for cello, the music will be crafted out of what the cello does really well. On the other hand, I am still open to a sort of cross-pollination between instruments. It’s so much fun to reimagine the cello as an electric guitar or a drum. This approach leads towards music that otherwise might not have been written.</p><br /><br /><p>Often, I’m doing prep-work for 2-3 pieces that are to be written in the coming year; actively composing one; and doing detail work on publishing the previous piece. It’s a cycle.</p><br /><br /><p>When it comes time to begin actively composing, pieces often start out on a blank sheet of 11/17” paper. With no lines, I am free to draw whatever I want. Often, I think in big, formal shapes and what the overall character of the piece will be. I’ll write out all the important pitches, rhythms, and colors. This is all a global way of thinking about the piece as a whole. It’s a “getting to know you” phase as I start to understand what the piece will be like in ever-increasing resolution.</p><br /><br /><p>Next, I begin fleshing out specific passages. Rarely do I ever write the sections of a piece in chronological order. After the first draft of a passage is complete there’s editing-lots of editing. I hardly ever get things right the first time, yet every part of the process is enjoyable.</p><br /><br /><p>As mentioned with FuseBox, we are presenting pieces based on Claude Debussy’s Sonata for Flute, Viola, and Harp. In preparation for my contribution to the concert, I have been listening to Debussy’s music as well as the music that influenced him; reading up on the historical/social context in which he was writing and considering what musical statement I can make that would resonate well with his work. He composed this piece in the summer of 1915, and so it is exactly 100 years later that we are composing music for the same instruments. It’s thrilling. It’s been on my mind for months and I am just now on the verge of grabbing a sheet of blank paper and diving in.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/161986523&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How do you break through creative blocks?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I’m so glad you asked this question. The answer is simple: write what you know.</p><br /><br /><p>Don’t try to break through creative blocks. Instead, write what you already know about the music and in the process of doing so you may discover the missing answers to questionable sections your piece. For example, if you know how the piece ends but not how it begins, write the ending first. The end may unlock the beginning.</p><br /><br /><p>Sometimes, my initial sketches look so skeletal that they hardly resemble the final product. Yet, certain aspects are there in their essential form. They’re incomplete because that’s all I knew about the music at the time of the sketching. If you listen carefully, these initial clues always suggest more beyond themselves.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What advice do you have for younger composers?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Listen. Always remember that you are working within a sonic medium. The music should be grounded in how you want it to sound. No extraneous concept can make up for an inconsiderate soundscape. You are doing your job if like what you are hearing.</p><br /><br /><p>When you write music for live performance, be keenly aware of the people who will be playing it. Too often I encounter pieces by composers who have somehow forgotten that they are writing music for other human beings to play. The best way to get a sense of how to play with others is to do it yourself. Go play in a band or a large ensemble or a chamber group. These experiences will teach you how to play well with others. Let THAT inform the way you write. I learned most of what I know about music through playing it.</p><br /><br /><p>Only you can write your music. Only you can decide what is valuable. Only you can define what success means for yourself.</p><br /><br /><p>Be a big picture thinker. Understand that many projects take a couple years to get off the ground. Most of my 2015 projects are the products of work done back in 2014 or even 2013. Be patient. Go to concerts. Don’t meet others merely to “network.” Instead, really get to know people. Be part of a community; nurture your professional friendships with sincerity and compassion; give back to those who have been generous to you.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/149664439&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Who or what inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>That's a broad, broad question. Our lives are so interconnected with everything else that every experience I've had has helped shape the composer I am.</p><br /><br /><p>Books inspire me all the time. I feel like I can't manage to compose a cohesive piece if I'm not actively reading a book. Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse V was the first work of art that inspired me to think about form. To this day, I think I've learned more about form from authors than composers.</p><br /><br /><p>Color is very important in my music. I'm synesthetic, which means that certain sensory inputs trigger a specific response from other senses. In my case, I hear sounds and see colors. Every piece I write is composed in colors. Looking at one of my works-in-progress is like standing in a three-dimensional workshop with all sounds represented spatially. Do I think this makes me a better composer? No. It's just what works for me, and it's not important for listeners to try to imagine the colors. They should just listen.</p><br /><br /><p>My most recent musical developments have been shaped through talking with Jun, my partner. She's a flutist, and her aesthetic tastes are polar to mine. She's a capital R Romantic, whereas I am someone who falls after Post-Modernism (we shouldn't write post-post-post...etc.) and my tastes, though varied, tend towards more recent works. I'm grateful for our differences because they make for engaging conversations. While I do still enjoy building up large masses of sound, she has helped my music to sing. It's more melodic now because of her.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/153285750&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/165783332&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Scott’s Recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/503211036_midnights_children"">Midnight’s Children</a></em> by Salman Rushdie</p><br /><br /><p><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/758952036_labyrinths"">Labyrinths</a></em> by Jorge Luis Borges</p><br /><br /><p><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/322153036_slaughterhouse-five"">Slaughterhouse-Five</a></em> by Kurt Vonnegut</p><br /><br /><p><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/226703036_lolita"">Lolita</a></em> by Vladimir Nabokov</p><br /><br /><p><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1371099036_the_name_of_the_rose"">The Name of the Rose</a></em> by Umberto Eco</p><br /><br /><p><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/978835036_abbey_road"">Abbey Road</a></em> by the Beatles</p><br /><br /><p><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1131384036_amnesiac"">Amnesiac</a></em> by Radiohead</p><br /><br /><p><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1350054036_tre_voci"">Tre Voci,</a>: </em>performances by Tre Voci of Claude Debussy, Toru Takemitsu-san, and Sofia Gubaidalina</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/42069305&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1436370991","1484775684","0","0","Eclectic|Classical","classical|New Music","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/scott-steele","http://scottsteelecomposer.com/","Learn more about Scott's music projects here."

Whether you're new to contemporary classical music or are already a fan, you're in for a treat.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I live in Shawnee and work in Kansas City at the Conservatory. Depending on the time of year, a typical day for me includes teaching, writing, creating and sustaining arts programming (in the schools or through engagement involving art/music collaboration) and enjoying time with my ten year-old son.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>I’m curious about something you state in your Creative Philosophy: <em>I intend to achieve a relationship between the process of composing and the composition itself.</em> Can you delve a little into your own process of composing? What may surprise a listener of your music about how you create it?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>For me, composition requires a balance between the micro and the macro. My mode of working includes an understanding of the creative process, a reflection on that process, and a design of individually tailored tasks. Constant shifting between the big picture and the small steps is critical.</p><br /><br /><p>I map my musical ideas obsessively. It helps me to discover the relationship between the macro and the micro connections between my ideas. I draw a lot of inspiration from visual arts, specifically the process of the abstract expressionists. As Morton Feldman identifies the “more perceptive temperament [of the painter] that waits and observes the inherent mystery of its materials, as opposed to the composer’s vested interest in his craft” (Zimmermann 1985, 90). Rather than convince my listener of my ideas, I am interested in breaking down barriers between the listener and the composer, so as to include the experience itself, allowing the listener to hear a piece of music as evolving. In my music and collaborations, I intend to achieve a relationship between the process of composing and the composition itself.</p><br /><br /><p>I talk more specifically about my mapping process here: <a href=""http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/rethinking-how-we-teach-composition-part-1/"">http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/rethinking-how-we-teach-composition-part-1/</a></p><br /><br /><p>Generally, I emphasize the use of orchestration, particularly, the blending of sounds in my music. I am especially interested in the moment that the start of one sound and the ending of another become blurred. I aim to create a musical continuum between seemingly opposing parts. Ultimately, I hope to prompt questions about the distinction between the real and the unreal, or “imaginary.”</p><br /><br /><p>As a listener, I cherish surprises. A composer, whether admitted or not, creates a certain system (or form) for his/her ideas. I think we can tell a lot about a composer by the manner in which he/she holds steady to these “systems.” For example, Bach creates a system, then breaks his own rules. These moments are the best for a composers to study. In the case of Bach, he always makes the choice for musical reasons.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/47108161&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/20724305&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Can you point to one time in your life where you knew you wanted to be a composer? Who inspired you early on to create new music and what were your earliest compositions like?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>It happened late for me. In high school, I had some hints that I wanted to be a composer, but it was not until college that I became convinced -- as Verdi said, ""I surrendered to being a composer"" -- in a sense, that is sort of true for me. It was less a choice for me and more of a discovery. If I do not write for a few weeks, I feel incomplete.</p><br /><br /><p>I had a very influential piano teacher in high school (Marjorie Mitchell), and amazing music professors at Bennington. I met Betsy Jolas my senior year. She introduced me to the ""Rite of Spring"" in a class with Allen Shawn. I still have that marked up score! I then attended her summer session at the American Conservatory in Fontainebleau. That same year, I took a class on the Beethoven String Quartets which also changed the way I hear music.</p><br /><br /><p>While I have all of my college compositions, I rarely look at them. In graduate school, I made a decision that I would write as much as possible and not look back. The only piece I have ever revised since was Map of Rain Hitting Water (2006/2012).</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>You have studied, performed and have had your work premiered in many places throughout the world. What have been some of the highlights for you of your travels and musical experiences?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Highlights include Banff, Thailand, England and Europe, though I think I would have to say that Banff was my most transformative time. It was the first residency I ever did. Being surrounded by mountains and artists in seclusion helped me carve out a process in the real world for being a composer.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/48968251&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What advice do you have for younger composers?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Listen to and question everything<br /><br /><br />	Hear what you compose and compose what you hear<br /><br /><br />	Organize what you compose (know where/when things belong)<br /><br /><br />	Create a structure/language for what you compose/hear</p><br /><br /><p>Meet as many performers as you can and actively seek out performances for your work.

Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Hello, I am Thom Hoskins. I write, record and perform my own music. I have been a music lover/musician since I was 13. I play several different instruments and I work out of my home studio in a quiet neighborhood in Lenexa, Kansas. My days usually begin very early making coffee out of my French press, which is the only way to brew coffee as far as I am concerned. After a night of rest or something like it I occasionally try to make sense out of the dreams I’ve had the night before. For me there is a point in which I cannot remember what I have dreamt the night before. So If I believe a dream has some meaning or truth to it I write down my thoughts before they are forgotten. I have even used some of my dream journal writings and turned them into lyrics before. When my wife goes to work and my children have gone to school I begin to rehearse and compose. My rehearsals largely consist of me rehearsing in my home studio, which can usually turn into a recording session very quickly.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/193879512&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/201763512&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>While many of your lyrics are introspective, your music is very melodic and hook-driven in a way that recalls classic pop. What do you find most fulfilling and challenging about working</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>within this musical model?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I enjoy aspects of pop music but I try not to think about a specific genre when I write.</p><br /><br /><p>I find if I were to label the music I write in terms of genre it would force the song to take on more recognizable patterns. I believe the challenge in writing music is how to make music fresh for listeners. Having a distinct style while maintaining elements of familiarity is something I continually strive for in my writing.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Describe your creative process. What tools do you use? How do you break through creative blocks?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Lyrically I try to continue to take new approaches to my writing. I enjoy using methods like character studies; automatic writing, world history and my own personal life as a way to write. I have a smartphone tape recorder app so that if I get a good idea for a chord progression or a melody I quickly record the idea. I always keep a pen and paper because even single phrase can turn into an entire song. The idea of creative blocks in writing for me is a way to describe a writer who is forcing his or her own process. I see inspiration as an ongoing natural progression that can only be harnessed by the unconscious mind. The pursuit of writing a good song takes time.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/181230868&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/132116941&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What advice do you have for younger songwriters?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My advice for young songwriters is to find a process that works for you and be patience with your process. Actively listening to a lot of music, reading for pleasure and looking at art is also important, as this will broaden your mind. Also practice playing your instrument in unconventional ways is a way to become a more accomplished performer. For instance, if you are a guitar player who plays with a pick instead play the guitar with your fingers. Finding a rhythm to writing music can be difficult. But sometimes the way to finish a song means changing your perspective on how to write it. Speaking of writing, write as much as you can. Any genre any mood that will challenge you will help you improve how you write.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Who or what inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The list of things and people that inspire my writing continues to grow but if I had to list a few ways that I become inspired, I would tell you; I enjoy painting, meditating, riding my vintage French road bike. Also my children’s curiosity helps me continue to be ever inquisitive and my wife’s work in interpersonal communication at KU can be thought provoking enough to spark a great dialogue. So you see even conversation can be inspiring to songwriters.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br />      <div ><div ><br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/meciS6Hv7m4?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/5VVKOs1IPvE?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />          </div><br /><br />  </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Thom's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>1. <strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/607716036_here,_there_and_everywhere"">Here, there and everywhere: My Life recording the Beatles</a></em></strong> <strong>by Geoff Emerick.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Everyone in the world knows about the Beatles.

Paige is an established performer and songwriter whose new Nashville-born album <a href=""http://jesspaige.com/store/""><em>Sweet</em>;<em>Nothings</em></a> showcases the growth of a versatile talent. Grounded in classic pop-soul and a voice that sounds wise beyond her years, Paige's music has a wide appeal that never compromises her uniqueness. For this edition of Listen Local, Paige was kind enough to delve into her songwriting and recording processes, with some valuable lessons learned from the road and studio, some personal picks from the Johnson County Library catalog and some samples from <em>Sweet Nothings.</em></p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about yourself. How long have you been a musician and songwriter?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I feel like the answer to this question is, my whole life. Even when I was a tiny kid, I would run around our farm making up songs, and singing incessantly! I was in second grade the first time I sang by myself on a stage. I always knew what I wanted to be. Which, feels like a rare gift to be given; direction.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Describe your songwriting process. Who or what inspires you? How do you break through creative blocks?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I tend to write from my own experience, or stories I can connect to from people around me. I do these, what I would call, songwriting ""exercises"" when I am driving, or I could be doing anything, really... I try and come up with as many different ways to communicate what I am thinking, feeling or observing, lyrically. So through use of imagery, metaphor, or a very simple literal description. Exercising that muscle in your brain makes it so much more effortless to actually create the song when you finally you have something you want to write about. I am also writing all the time, or playing with chord progressions and melodies. You will come up with a lot of junk but you never know which one is going to be magic and wonderful.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/227257535&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You have traveled throughout the United States and have chosen Kansas City as your musical home. What did touring teach you about songwriting and performing?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The best performances and touring experiences are the least expected. You might be super excited for this great venue in some big city that you booked on a wing and a prayer, and then the night turns out to be a complete wash... Then, next day at noon on a Sunday, you roll into a tiny town in Iowa, population 150, and EVERYONE comes to the one bar that's next door to the one church, super excited to have you and appreciate your music. You walk away from those experiences feeling intensely connected with people. That is a gift of touring or traveling in general. The connection with perfect strangers where you get to share with them and they get to share with you. It transcends any superficial difference that might exist in other circumstances. It's absolutely beautiful.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Where is your favorite place to perform and why?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My home! When it smells like incense and coffee, Hah. I think that's why I prefer to perform in places that feel less contrived and more natural. It isn't a particular place as much as a particular feeling. I love performing in space that people are truly comfortable and the music feels more like a conversation than a concert. That might be a back porch or it could be next to a campfire or concert hall. Those shows are rare and certainly the best.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/164047451&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Where and how do you record your music? What advice do you have for others who want to do the same?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I recorded my album ""Sweet Nothings"" in Nashville at Ocean Way Studios and Beech Creek Studios. But, I record a lot of songs (for memory sake, when I write them) using my Zoom H4 recorder or Iphone. I have a compressor mic and great headphones for mixing, if I feel like getting super involved, but I like to leave the recording to the professionals.</p><br /><br /><p>If I could go back and do things differently, here is what I would tell myself; stop trying to DIY. The money is worth the investment, if you have worked on your songs enough, to go have someone who knows the art of recording to record you. Expect for it to cost twice what you think and take twice as long. HIRE STUDIO MUSICIANS. There is an art to playing music live and an art to playing for a record, they are not the same skills. Shop around! I started recording in KC and found out that for the same amount of money I could record in a better studio, with better musicians in Nashville. You also have to speak out about your creative direction and know when to collaborate ideas. This is tough because it is incredibly difficult to communicate creative notions effectively. Most importantly, enjoy the ride. Your first recordings are not going to be your best, so just appreciate your growth as an artist and the journey that comes with being a musician.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br />      <div ><div ><br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/PoG5rT5WqI0?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/piRZlu3afUA?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />          </div><br /><br />  </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Jessica's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>These reads are going to broaden your thinking with great narratives.

Currently a senior at Lee's Summit West High School, West is also a talented singer and guitarist whose work you'll be hearing more from in the years to come. In this interview, West describes her earliest songwriting efforts, what she does now to get inspired and shares her list of book recommendations.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourself. Where do you go to school?  How long have you been writing songs? </strong></p><br /><br /><p>I'll be entering this year as a senior at Lee's Summit West High School; I've lived around here my whole life. I have been writing little songs and dancing around my room for as long as I can remember. Most of the ""songs"" I wrote when I was little were about candy or my dog. In fourth grade, my dad and brother started learning the guitar, and I wanted to as well. I got a bright blue Luna guitar that Christmas and started learning the basics. In sixth grade, I started pairing lyrics and melodies with chords on the guitar. After that I had to learn the actual structure of a song, and by seventh grade I was writing full songs. Now I don't know what I'd do without it. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/219102867&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/219107292&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your creative process with songwriting. What tools do you use to write and/or record your music? </strong></p><br /><br /><p>My songwriting process varies. Sometimes I'll start with a chord progression and then add lyrics and melody, or I just start with a melody in my head, then add lyrics and chords. Sometimes I sit down, pick up my guitar, and it all comes at once. Throughout the day I'll randomly think of phrases that could be put into lyrics, so I have a whole Notes page on my phone dedicated to that. At home I have notebooks of songs, fully written or just partly done. When I start a song, I usually record it on my phone. I continue to update the recordings as I work on the song, and eventually I might post it on YouTube or SoundCloud. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please share a story about moving through a period of creative struggle. What got you through?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I definitely do experience writer's block. Sometimes the pieces just don't fit together like I want them to, or my mind is completely blank. Whenever this happens, I have to take a break. I won't play for a few days, and usually I can come back and work it out. The important thing for me is to not try too hard. My guitar teacher once pointed out that when I feel like I'm writing a crappy song, just keep writing, but don't put so much pressure on it. If I overthink and worry, then everything just feels forced and I can't write music like that. I have to feel what I'm writing and be excited about it; I want it to be an emotional and passionate experience. A lot of times if I just let go of the pressure, things flow naturally and it's a lot more productive.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/219105089&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/208553240&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Who or what inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I'm inspired by people's drive to move on and stick together. I believe that naturally we want to grow as people and move past pain and hurt. I love how people find comfort in one another, it brings us all together. Having a healthy support system is such an important part of getting through life. Music is so great at bringing people together, and I love that. I want my songs to be a cornerstone for people going through tough times. I want to show people that they are not alone, and I hope my songs are something they can relate to. <br /><br /><br />	 </p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Bailey's recommendations from the Johnson County Library Catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1077870036_i_am_j"">I am J</a> </strong>by Cris Beam</p><br /><br /><p>I read this a few years ago and it has stuck with me ever since.

Her books are raw, emotional, and they also open your eyes to a broad range of perspectives. Hate List is about a high school girl whose boyfriend brought a gun to school with the mission of killing everyone on a ""Hate List"" of people from their school that had bullied them. Bitter End follows the relationship of a high school girl and a boy, whom she falls in love with, but he starts abusing her. Both books help you be more understanding to people stuck in those situations. For me, it provided a perspective that I had never thought of before. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/898196036_wintergirls"">Wintergirls</a> </strong>by Laurie Halse Anderson </p><br /><br /><p>This is about a young girl who struggles with eating disorders and self image. I also feel like this book is raw and fresh; there are multiple quotes I have picked out from this book because it really hits home sometimes. It shows perspective on what a lot of young girls think about their bodies, what they are raised and conformed to believe about themselves... And how that impacts them in such unhealthy ways.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br />      <div ><div ><br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/d6G3vJ4CXGI?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/PyeLe-Qnyeo?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />          </div><br /><br />  </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/219102867&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/793039036_thirteen_reasons_why"">13 Reasons Why</a> </strong>by Jay Asher </p><br /><br /><p>This is set from the perspective of a high school boy who receives a box of record tapes.

The tapes explain a succession of events throughout her life that lead up to her decision to take her life. Each side of 7 tapes had a story addressed to a certain person. This was also a very moving and emotional book, one that hits home for many as well. </p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p>Side note: These books are emotional and can get depressing, but I think it's really important to read and learn about other people's struggles. It helps so that we are more understanding to a broader range of people and their situations. Books like these put you in their shoes and it can change your perspective. I love books that make me feel and make me think.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1441299255","1484773135","0","0","Singer - Songwriter|Folk - Americana","singer-songwriter|folk","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/bailey-west","https://soundcloud.com/baileyest","Hear more of Bailey's music here."

Originally from Lewisville, Texas, Luttrell is currently a Master's student in Music Composition at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. His list of accomplishments is already impressive and fans of new classical music will find much to enjoy in his work. We were fortunate to have Luttrell answer some questions about his (surprisingly short) history as a composer, his work habits, and what he appreciates about the Kansas City music scene, among other topics. He has also shared some recent compositions. Enjoy the music!</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I’m originally from Lewisville, TX (a city near Dallas), but now I live a few minutes north of Westport in Kansas City, where I’m working towards my Master’s at UMKC. I’m currently between steady jobs, but I do some freelancing as a composer and teacher.</p><br /><br /><p>A normal day for me starts early, with a wet face – my Australian Shepherd puppy doesn’t like to sleep in, and he’s a licker. During the school year, I try to compose every morning, but during summer breaks I don’t keep much of a routine. In my “old age” of 23, I’ve found that mornings no longer exist unless I have a strong source of caffeine nearby. I usually can’t get any composing done during the afternoon, either. My productive times are early mornings or late nights.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/145839361&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Delve a little into your own process of composing. What may surprise a listener of your music about how you create it? What tools do you use?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>To be completely honest, my process is a bit of a mess! But that’s by design. I’m very much ruled by my ADD, so sticking to any one consistent process is typically more stifling than useful. When I’m in the thick of a piece, I’m usually pacing around my room surrounded by an explosion of paper, most of it crumpled up into balls or only half-filled. Composing for me is a very scattered and stressful (but fun!) experience, and I probably look more than a little insane while working. </p><br /><br /><p>I’m extremely fond of building “mind-maps” (you know, the visual outline format with all the bubbles or boxes that connect to or build off of each other) on large format paper. This format allows as much scatterbrained thinking as possible, while still having a core organizational path that I can follow when I look back on it later.</p><br /><br /><p>Speaking of planning, I usually spend a few months thinking about a piece and working out the large-scale ideas before I ever put a single note on the page or the screen. I’m using pencil and paper far more often now than I used to, which comes from a desire to spend more time closely considering the ideas that I come up with. Before the past year, literally all of my work happened in the Sibelius notation program, where you can have an idea, input it in seconds, and get aural feedback right away, versus having to use your ear and imagination with paper. It’s a completely different mindset, which I find fascinating.</p><br /><br /><p>As a fun game, I hide a tiny, tiny snippet of the <em>Jurassic Park </em>theme by John Williams in each of my pieces.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/iymPjhoZtRI?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/145839358&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Can you point to one time in your life where you knew you wanted to be a composer? Who inspired you early on to create new music and what were your earliest compositions like?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I’m still relatively quite new to all of this – it took a long time for me to “become” a composer. I didn’t start composing at all until the summer before I started college in 2010, and it was almost two more years after that before I committed to taking it seriously. I enrolled in college as a Music Education major, largely because Younger-Me believed that it was the only music degree that would land me a steady job. Composing was just too risky!</p><br /><br /><p>Luckily, thanks to a few key friends and some choice words from my undergrad professor, Dr. BJ Brooks (“What would you do if you weren’t afraid?” among other things), I found the courage to take the leap and really commit, and I haven’t looked back since.</p><br /><br /><p>My earliest compositions were… bad. The few times I’m brave enough to go back and listen, I can see the beginnings of my style starting to peek out, but nothing good enough to see the light of day. They’re a picture of the composer I was at the time, so I still look back at them with some fondness… but they were bad. Around my junior year, some sort of switch flipped, and I figured things out well enough to write what I consider my first real piece, <em>Saxophone Quartet No. 1</em>.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/tBDJZXYQ4kc?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/145839354&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What excites you the most about projects you’re currently working on?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I have a couple of projects that I’m super excited about:</p><br /><br /><p>New Words, New Music is a collaborative program I’m developing with Annie DelSignore, a poet that I met back in high school. The program will pair young composers and writers at similar points in their careers to collaboratively create a new work from the ground up. More and more in this increasingly digital age, collaboration between various arts and artists is one of the most important things we do, and Annie and I hope to provide a safe, risk-free opportunity for many young artists.</p><br /><br /><p>	We’re currently working on a song cycle of our own as a pilot season, and hope to launch the real thing toward the end of this year!<br /><br /><br />	 </p><br /><br /><p>Collective – Myself and two friends of mine –  Clay Allen (<a href=""http://www.clayallenmusic.com/"">http://www.clayallenmusic.com</a>) and Austin Brake (<a href=""http://novatonalis.com/)"">http://novatonalis.com/)</a> – are forming a composer collective.

I don’t completely understand why, but I seem to have many more compositional epiphanies when I read or learn about other fields – photography, cinematography, painting, dance, writing; the list goes on. Something about the way authors specifically organize their thoughts really resonates with me, and affects the formal structures in my music.</p><br /><br /><p>Kansas City also inspires me. This city is an <em>amazing</em> place for music, and my horizons have broadened hugely even after just a single year of living here. There’s a level of support for music in KC that is very rare, which certainly gives me hope for my future career!</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Alex Luttrell Recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/344325036_on_writing"">On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft</a></strong></em> by Stephen King</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/661335036_name_of_the_wind"">The Name of the Wind</a></strong></em> by Patrick Rothfuss</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1174377036_jiro_dreams_of_sushi"">Jiro Dreams of Sushi</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1312282036_the_wind_rises"">The Wind Rises</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1242074036_the_symphonies"">The Symphonies</a></strong></em> – Witold Lutoslawski (Esa-Pekka Salonen with the LA Philharmonic)</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1437648855","1484775197","0","0","Classical","classical","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/alex-luttrell","http://www.charlesluttrell.com/","Learn more about Alex Luttrell's music here."

As both solo artist and keyboardist for the Kansas City jazz outfit <a href=""https://www.reverbnation.com/shadesofjade"">Shades of Jade</a>, Mason performs widely in and around Kansas City in addition to his position as Director of Music at Good Samaritan Missionary Baptist Church (not to mention his day job at Park University's Registrar's Office). He is a relentlessly creative artist who composes on the bus, on his lunch breaks, and anywhere else he finds inspiration. Mason was generous enough to share some insights into his creative endeavors as well as an extensive list of the music, movies and books that provide inspiration to him on a daily basis.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Desmond Mason AKA dmasontheprofessor, and I'm a multi-instrumentalist/composer/producer from Kansas City, MO. Most times, you'll catch me playing piano, Hammond B3 organ, keyboards, synthesizers and vocoder, although I've had past experience playing drums, violin, and bass guitar. My day job consists of working at Park University in Parkville, MO in the Registrar's Office where I process student records of all sorts (putting my history degree from UMKC to good use!). During some evenings of the month, I am playing music at multiple venues around the Kansas City metropolitan area such as The Phoenix Jazz Club, The Green Lady Lounge, The Tank Room, Coda Bar and Grill, Sullivan's Steakhouse in Leawood, and a plethora of other venues. During other evenings, I'm either rehearsing with my main outfit Shades of Jade, or creating/composing. Every weekend, I render service as Director of Music at Good Samaritan Missionary Baptist Church.</p><br /><br /><p>My typical day is rather busy all week around. I'm basically working a full-time job and two part time jobs due to my commitments to Shades of Jade and Good Samaritan MBC. During weekdays, like I alluded to above, I go to work 8am-4:30pm at Park then I do one of three things: rehearse/create, gig, or spend time with family. During the weekend, I usually rehearse and play service on Saturday and Sunday mornings then I either rehearse/create, gig, or spend time with my family. I'm a very busy man that takes small hiatuses here or there when needed. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/214322858&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Can you point to one time in your life where you knew you wanted to be a songwriter? Who inspired you early on to write music and what were your earliest compositions like?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I think I wanted to be a songwriter/composer ever since I formally started music in elementary school. I just didn't have the confidence to act on that desire until I joined a jazz combo in college while working towards my history degree. During my time in the combo, I wrote my first ever tune called ""Prelude to Stage II"". It's a sad tune that also longs for the future (I wrote this shortly after breaking up with my high school sweetheart). After performing it live for the first time with the jazz combo, and after I saw the really positive reaction it garnered from the audience and my instructor, I was finally confident in my songwriting/composing skills to dedicate time to it.</p><br /><br /><p>As you can tell, I was inspired to write by life experiences. I think all of the tunes that I've written and performed thus far have came from life experiences. For example, I have two tunes (one sampled) on Shades of Jade's Fingerprinted Memories pt. 1, called ""At Work"" and ""The Pleasant Part of the Grind"" (sampled in Dominique Sander's ""Daydreaming""). ""At Work"" was written literally during my ten minute break one day at Park University and it represents the environment around my office, especially the view of Parkville from the third floor in Mackay Hall (majestic). ""The Pleasant Part of the Grind"" was written one day on public transportation right after I got a $500 check for some debate coaching I did on the side. Life experiences influences the colors that I use in my compositions.</p><br /><br /><p>My earliest compositions are much like my latest ones, except for the fact that my recent compositions have been influenced more by people than life experiences. For example, all of the tracks that I've made that's on my <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/dmasontheprofessor"">soundcloud</a> page were all made with an influence or local singer in mind (as I am trying to prove my worth as a producer). My most recent tune is a biographical tune in honor of my high school debate coach Leon Scroggins aptly called ""Mr. Scroggins"". Nevertheless, most of my compositions have easily singable melodies and forms because I strive to create music with or without lyrics that people can feel.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/163141616&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You’re active as both a solo artist and as a member of the jazz fusion ensemble Shades of Jade. How did you get involved with Shades of Jade? How does this collaboration inform your own work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The story of how I got involved with <a href=""https://www.reverbnation.com/shadesofjade"">Shades of Jade</a> changes depending on who you ask. When/if you interview Shades of Jade, you should ask Josh a similar question about each member of the group! From my perspective, it was a random occurrence. I was on hiatus from pursuing my history degree approximately four-plus years ago and one day I was called in for an audition at a room within the performing arts center at UMKC (I think Ryan Lee referred me, but my memory's foggy; I was referred for sure though). This is when I met trumpeter Josh Williams for the first time. I already knew Dominique Sanders and Ryan Lee on bass and drums respectively (which completed the very first lineup; the lineup has changed several times after that, with myself being the constant most of the time). We played through some tunes, all of them which I read from sight and I was a member of Shades of Jade after that. I still have access to a few recordings from that day, and let me tell you, Shades has come a LONG WAY musically since the beginning!</p><br /><br /><p>This collaboration has informed my work in groups and on my own big time, and has given me opportunities to play music in public, especially play MY music in public, that I otherwise wouldn't have had or that would've taken me longer to realize. Shades of Jade is definitely a vehicle for experimentation with compositional/songwriting ideas because of the level of musicianship at each instrument in the group. This collaboration also made my views about the end-all purpose of music more mature. The goal of Shades of Jade is to paint musical pictures about life's experiences. This is very similar to my approach to composition/songwriting, which gives my creativity and music making an ultimate purpose.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/212445143&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/214783341&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Delve a little into your own process of songwriting.

All of my songs have really come spontaneously out of a feeling, and they have been written for the most part very quickly. In my answer to another question, I spoke about it taking only ten minutes and a short bus ride to compose songs. I also have this other song out with lyrics called ""Into the Unknown"". Into the Unknown came about 30 minutes after a band rehearsal, and the poem that's set to the music was written on another ten minute break at work. So most times, my creative process is a sprint rather than a marathon, most times. The process is slower when I'm creating tracks for others while producing, because I like to think about instrumental and musical arrangements a great deal before I settle on a finished product to put out. Nevertheless, the creative process is boom or bust for me and starts and stops at very random times.</p><br /><br /><p>When listeners hear my music, I think they will be most surprised by how quick my music was conceived and created. Both ""At Work"" and ""Into the Unknown"" have tricky time signature changes and chord change sequences to establish a certain mood, yet both were conceived in the span of an hour!</p><br /><br /><p>When composing music, I use anything at my disposal, including just my brain, some staff paper and a pen/pencil. Most times, I use a piano that's available, my Yamaha MOXF8 at home, or I bring my Yamaha MX61 to work to do music during lunch break. Both ""At Work"" and ""The Pleasant Part of the Grind"" were composed with only my brain, a pocket staff book and pen/pencil, however. When it comes to production work and composing in that way, I use cubase, my macbook, and my MX61 as a controller. When inspiration hits, I really use what's available to me at that time. I usually don't record instances of inspiration aurally. I usually hurriedly write them down, and then develop them in outfits such as Shades of Jade later. My itunes library, outside of life's inspiration, is a very important composition tool as well because the music of my predecessors provides some foundation for my original music (this is true for every creator in music, as all composers/songwriters are influenced by a composer/songwriter that has done it before). </p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Talk about your musical influences.</strong> <strong>Who or what inspires you now?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I've had many formative experiences in music, so I'll give a compact summary of these experiences.  I first wanted to do music due to my grandmother renting me a violin and the talented musicians at Palestine Missionary Baptist Church when I was a child. I started playing drums after seeing the late Adam Williams Sr. play drums, and then I REALLY wanted to play B3 organ after seeing Richard Marks Jr. play organ for the young adult choir. What attracted me to his style was that he sounded different from everyone else and the chords he was playing were very dark and modern. I wanted to be cool and make music like that! Later, the music of Joe Pace and the Colorado Mass Choir really influenced my gospel playing. I was forced to take piano lessons, however, by another organist at PMBC (which was made possible by Drs. Nelson and Anne Johnson, to which I am forever grateful) to gain the technique necessary to play organ. It was under Scott Anthony at the community music and dance academy at UMKC where I fell in love with the music of Frederic Chopin.</p><br /><br /><p>Not long after starting lessons, I first heard ""Just Squeeze Me"" by the Duke Ellington Orchestra, and I said to myself ""I want to play music like that for the rest of my life!"". Not long after this, I was introduced to the music of Bill Evans, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, McCoy Tyner, Herbie Hancock, Joe Henderson, and a host of others that made me fall in love more with Jazz. Bill Evans became my favorite pianist for his phrasing, and especially how he accompanied his own solos with his left hand chords. I will also argue with anybody that Bill Evans is the best ever at piano at playing the solo ballad. I have most of the music Bill Evans has ever made in my iTunes library. Herbie Hancock is another big influence. In high school, I was introduced to the music of Kanye West, then to The Roots, then to Lupe Fiasco and others which fostered my love for hip-hop, especially live hip-hop. Kamal Gray from The Roots is another influence as far as my piano playing.</p><br /><br /><p>Then in college, I was introduced to the music of pianist Robert Glasper, and he's one of the two artists I've tried to model myself after. With my intro to Robert Glasper, I was also introduced to Casey Benjamin, the vocoderist and the saxophonist with the Robert Glasper experiment. Benjamin is quite literally the best at vocoder that I've ever heard, and his work inspired me to take up the vocoder and to experiment with synths and effects in my live and produced music making. I also think Benjamin and Glasper are two of the best musicians at establishing moods with their music and establishing a rapport with their audiences. Correctly conveying mood and establishing rapport with my composing and music making are two things that I strive for today because of what Glasper and Benjamin done in music. As far as production, I am most inspired by Kendrick Lamar's album To Pimp a Butterfly. That album is a masterpiece as far as production, and the realism on that album is something I strive for when creating tracks.</p><br /><br /><p>Last but not least, I continue to be inspired by life, and the good and the bad, or what rapper Lupe Fiasco calls the ""Food"" and the ""Liquor"", that comes with it!</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p>These ten albums all affected me musically in a positive way:</p><br /><br /><p>1. <strong><em>Waltz For Debby</em> by Bill Evans Trio</strong>. This was one of the two albums (a big band compilation featuring the Duke Ellington Orchestra) that made me want to play jazz. This was also the album that made me fall in love with the piano playing of Bill Evans. Starting with this album, I've stockpiled many Bill Evans albums, many of which I still listen to today. Also check out You Must Believe in Spring, I Will Say Goodbye, and the two Paris Concerts CDs for some very emotion-provoking music!</p><br /><br /><p>2.<em><strong> <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/575469036_my_funny_valentine"">My Funny Valentine</a></strong></em> <strong>by Miles Davis Quintet</strong>. This is a great jazz album from start to finish. I would also argue that Herbie Hancock (one of my favorite pianists and foremost influences) took the best piano solo I've ever heard on ""All of You"". This solo has been mentioned at length in a couple of jazz theory books I keep at home.</p><br /><br /><p>3. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/205595036_a_love_supreme"">A Love </a></strong></em><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/205595036_a_love_supreme"">Supreme</a> </strong></em><strong>by</strong><strong>John</strong><strong> Coltrane Quartet.</strong> This suite was composed by John Coltrane for the God he believed in, and has a lot of religious overtones. McCoy Tyner (another one of my favorite pianists) takes excellent solos on ""Resolution"" and ""Pursuance"".</p><br /><br /><p>4. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/509564036_the_college_dropout"">The College Dropout</a></strong></em>  <strong>by Kanye West.</strong> This album really got me into hip-hop in my high school years. Classic from start to finish.</p><br /><br /><p>5. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1169390036_black_radio"">Black </a></strong></em><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1169390036_black_radio"">Radio</a> </strong></em><strong>by</strong><strong> Robert Glasper.</strong> Glasper is my foremost influence currently as far as my music. Glasper has put out many great albums, but this is a near-perfect mesh of jazz and R&B/Soul.</p><br /><br /><p>6. <strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1373389036_black_messiah"">Black </a></em><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1373389036_black_messiah"">Messiah</a> </em>by D'Angelo</strong>. D'Angelo is a genius and has not lost it. That is all.</p><br /><br /><p>7. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1387097036_to_pimp_a_butterfly"">To Pimp a Butterfly</a></strong></em> <strong>by Kendrick Lamay</strong>. Instant classic in popular hip-hop and conscious hip-hop in my opinion. This album has also heavily influenced the way I go about and think about producing tracks.</p><br /><br /><p>8. <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/798085036_lupe_fiascos_the_cool""><em><strong>Lupe Fiasco's the Cool</strong></em> </a> <strong>by Lupe Fiasco.</strong> This is second behind College Dropout in my pantheon of hip-hop albums. Classic from start to finish. I think this is the best album Lupe has ever made.</p><br /><br /><p>9. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/407968036_joe_pace_presents_shake_the_foundation"">Joe Pace Presents Shake the Foundation</a></strong></em>  <strong>by Joe Pace</strong>. The music of Joe Pace heavily influences my gospel music playing.</p><br /><br /><p>10. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/512628036_crossroads"">Crossroads</a></strong></em> <strong>by</strong> <strong>Deitrick Haddon</strong>. This album was one of the first gospel albums of my formative years and was one of the first that made me fall in love with non-traditional gospel music.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Books:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>1. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/426951036_coming_of_age_in_mississippi"">Coming of Age in Mississippi</a></strong></em> by Anne Moody</p><br /><br /><p>2. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/235725036_hard_times"">Hard Times</a></strong></em> by Studs Terkel</p><br /><br /><p>3. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/553368036_when_affirmative_action_was_white"">When Affirmative Action was White</a></strong></em> by Ira Katznelson</p><br /><br /><p>4. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/298170036_bill_evans"">Bill Evans: How My Heart Sings</a></strong></em> by Peter Pettinger</p><br /><br /><p>5. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1175279036_fire_in_the_ashes"">Fire in the Ashes</a></strong></em> by Jonathan Kozol</p><br /><br /><p>6. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/215283036_fig_pudding"">Fig Pudding</a></strong></em> by Ralph Fletcher.

For this edition of Listen Local, Kauhl shares some recent music and videos and sheds light on his creative process and the often collaborative nature of his craft.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourself. Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I’m a Kansas City-based composer and digital multimedia artist that frequently collaborates with local choreographers, composers, and visual artists. I live in Southtown Kansas City and work downtown during the day. Most days I take care of correspondence and technical facets of my art practice first and then reward myself with the more creative bits (that’s where coffee comes in!). On weekends, places like Crow’s Coffee at 51st and Brookside are wonderful to enjoy the sun and create art in a bustling yet productive environment. In between meetings with collaborators and other colleague’s exhibitions or concerts, typical days are often quite atypical.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" id=""vimeo-114844399"" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/114844399?width=640&height=360&color=00adef&portrait=1&title=1&byline=1&autoplay=0&loop=0&player_id=vimeo-114844399"" frameborder=""0"" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your creative process. What tools do you use? How do you go about finding and manipulating your sound sources?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My creative process is highly informed by my previous work and how I want to improve upon it. If I’m not convinced by a certain aspect of my most recent work, I am inclined to try the polar opposite approach in the next piece. In the process of its creation, that aspect often becomes something in between, which is often for the best.</p><br /><br /><p>I played a lot with Legos as a child and I envision the art I want to create much like how I used to plan and build new Lego creations. The sound or video samples I collect act as the building blocks and I then find elegant methods to construct the piece I imagine. I use Ableton Live to create music, Adobe Premiere to produce video, and Max by Cycling 74 to program unique audio effects and digital multimedia instruments utilizing cameras and sensors.</p><br /><br /><p><br /><br />	I collect my sound and video sources wherever I go. If for a piece I can’t easily procure a certain sound I have in mind, I can often find it on collaborative sound databases. For those sounds I collect myself, I post the original files to these databases as creative-commons, aiding others with similar endeavors. In order to preserve the moving image or sound’s natural characteristics, I tend to impose very little manipulation on the source recording.  Instead I rely upon finding creative ways to arrange these samples so that it either transcends or heightens its original meaning.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" id=""vimeo-105566322"" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/105566322?width=640&height=360&color=00adef&portrait=1&title=1&byline=1&autoplay=0&loop=0&player_id=vimeo-105566322"" frameborder=""0"" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/45590553&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How do you break through creative blocks?</strong><br /><br /><br />	I visualize creative blocks less as a “block” and more of an increasing exponential curve that has the potential to stand between myself and what I hope to create. For me, a creative block doesn’t immediately impose itself but can slowly creep up if I’m not careful. The only way to keep this exponential curve from rising is constantly finding new angles to look at what I’m making. If I’ve been working with a piece too long and am unsure of what to do next, I often put it down for a bit and work on something else or go for a walk. After I have gained some objectivity to the piece, I return to it and experience it in a new environment; this may be a different room, or a new place altogether.  From there, I can usually feel what’s been missing and resume.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" id=""vimeo-71072240"" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/71072240?width=640&height=360&color=00adef&portrait=1&title=1&byline=1&autoplay=0&loop=0&player_id=vimeo-71072240"" frameborder=""0"" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Tell us about your upcoming position as Composer-in-Residence at the Brush Creek (WY) Foundation for the Arts. What do you have planned?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Two months ago, the Brush Creek Foundation for the Arts furnished me with a residency in which I was provided a log cabin workspace, separate living space, and fully catered meals, so that I may create art unimpeded for the month of February. There I laid the groundwork programming for a collaboration with choreographer Brooke McPheeters in which two infrared cameras read and create music from the dancers’ movement. I also finished ‘Aurum’ a short video art piece, shown below. Finally, I recorded and produced an electrofolk cover of old Doc Watson tune, which will make its appearance with other electrofolk originals and reinterpretations on a near future CD release!</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Who or what inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>For me, inspiration comes from film, visual art, music, most any creative medium, but all of these sources share the same attributes as being intimate, honest, and understated on the surface yet shaded and detailed upon closer inspection. I like to be able to see straight into the creator’s soul through their music, whether it has vocals or is purely instrumental. Of the recommendations not listed below, I’m also highly inspired by artists such as Canon Blue, Ben Frost, Efterklang, and Fionn Regan. All of these musicians share this intimate honesty I strive to produce in my own music.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Cody's recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1373322036_carrie_amp_lowell"">Carrie & Lowell</a> by Sufjan Stevens </p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/378604036_vespertine"">Vespertine</a> by Bjork </p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1355693036_gone_girl"">Gone Girl (Soundtrack)</a> by Trent Reznor/Atticus Ross </p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1254419036_bright_sunny_south"">Bright Sunny South</a> by Sam Amidon </p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1308542036_benji"">Benji</a> by Sun Kil Moon </p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1146756036_wtc_911"">WTC 9/11</a> by Steve Reich </p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1341188036_they_want_my_soul"">They Want My Soul</a> by Spoon </p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1269885036_death_speaks"">Death Speaks</a> by David Lang </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1430240055","1484778145","0","0","Eclectic|Electronic|Experimental","experimental|instrumental","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/cody-kauhl","http://codykauhl.com/","Learn more about Cody's music here."

Connection and a sense of connectedness is one of our strongest human desires. In order for connection to happen in life and in music, we need to allow ourselves to be seen and heard authentically, removing all of those layers we wrap around our literal and figurative self. I always keep this in mind as I compose. I strive to write music that has the potential to make an emotional connection with the audience.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/135185138&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspired you to become a composer?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>One of my absolute favorite things that music can do is to give us goose bumps. This is also called musical-induced frisson. I am especially prone to this, perhaps because I grew up in a musical family and we listened to a lot of music. I can imagine certain passages of music in my mind and instantaneously give myself goose bumps. I remember as a child just loving this feeling. Who wouldn’t want to be in a profession that can do that!</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/K2jnLKJCyWk?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What advice do you have for younger composers?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Saturate</p><br /><br /><p>Incubate</p><br /><br /><p>Realize</p><br /><br /><p>Evaluate</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Who or what inspires you now?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Nature, words, silence, friends, students, travel, art…</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Ingrid's recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1273366036_bird_by_bird"" target=""_parent"" title=""Bird by Bird (Audiobook CD)"">Bird by Bird</a> By <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Lamott%2C+Anne%22&search_category=author&t=author"" target=""_parent"">Lamott, Anne</a></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1327857036_autobiography_of_a_yogi"" target=""_parent"" title=""Autobiography of A Yogi (Book)"">Autobiography of A Yogi</a> By <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Yogananda%22&search_category=author&t=author"" target=""_parent"">Yogananda</a></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/500832036_the_hours"" target=""_parent"" title=""The Hours (Book)"">The Hours</a> By <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Cunningham%2C+Michael%22&search_category=author&t=author"" target=""_parent"">Cunningham, Michael</a></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/271390036_the_wind-up_bird_chronicle"" target=""_parent"" title=""The Wind-up Bird Chronicle (Book)"">The Wind-up Bird Chronicle</a> By <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Murakami%2C+Haruki%22&search_category=author&t=author"" target=""_parent"">Murakami, Haruki</a></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/939256036_the_magic_mountain"" target=""_parent"" title=""The Magic Mountain (Book)"">The Magic Mountain</a> By <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Mann%2C+Thomas%22&search_category=author&t=author"" target=""_parent"">Mann, Thomas</a></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /></div>","0","717","1","1439830455","1492636172","0","0","Classical","composer|classical","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/ingrid-st%C3%B6lzel","http://www.ingridstolzel.com/","Learn more about Ingrid's music here."

Coming to us from Lenexa, Kansas, <a href=""http://www.janienextdoor.com"">Jane Christison</a> is a serious musician, performer and songwriter -- seriously fun, silly and experienced. While at UMKC working on a Bachelor of Music degree in Accordion Performance, Christison had the opportunity to travel internationally as part of the <a href=""http://www.uso.org/"">USO</a>. For this edition of Listen Local Christison shares stories from her extensive touring experience, how she tailors the music she writes for both children and senior audiences, and her advice for aspiring professional musicians. </p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about yourself. How did you get interested in music and performing?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>When I was nine years old, my Mom received a phone call asking, “Would you like to give your child a free musical test?”  She said “Sure, come on over.”  Since I was the oldest kid in the family, I got to take the test.</p><br /><br /><p>I don’t remember much about it other than the man told my parents that I got a good score.  He then signed me up for six weeks of accordion lessons and rented us a little accordion. </p><br /><br /><p>At the end of the six weeks of lessons, I was given another test.  My parents were told, “Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Christison, your daughter is so talented!”  I’m guessing they told all the parents that because that’s when they sold us an accordion, and I’ve been playing the accordion ever since.</p><br /><br /><p>I loved playing the accordion right from the first lesson, but I wasn’t all that excited about performing.  When people would come over to our house, my Dad would always say, “Janie, get out your accordion and play something.”  I’d trudge down the hall to get my accordion and a music stand and a chair, then head back toward the living room thinking, “Don’t make me do this.”</p><br /><br /><p>I was really shy, and I would get so nervous.  And recitals, oh my gosh, I’d get nosebleeds from nerves.  Yet, despite all that, I ended up moving to Kansas City to study accordion with Joan Sommers at the University of Missouri - Kansas City Conservatory of Music.</p><br /><br /><p>While at UMKC, I had no choice; I had to do performances.  And the more performing I did, the easier it became.  Now, performing and sharing my music with others is something I really enjoy doing.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/61397751&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Your musical education and experience are quite extensive. As a member of the USO you have performed pretty much everywhere. How did you involvement with USO come about? Care to share a story or two?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>While at UMKC working on a Bachelor of Music degree in Accordion Performance, I was in a performing group called The Accordionaires.  We played pop music and some light classics, plus some of us in the group also sang and danced in addition to playing accordion.  The group auditioned for, and was selected, to be part of USO Shows, in conjunction with the National Music Council. </p><br /><br /><p>On my first USO tour, we traveled and performed for 11 weeks in Korea, Japan, Okinawa, Taiwan, the Philippines and Guam.  What a great experience playing for our US military personnel.  They were definitely very appreciative audiences!  Two summers later, we were picked to go to the Azore Islands and Germany. </p><br /><br /><p>Traveling to and from performances was always interesting.  We had buses that broke down before we even left the parking lot, travel by jeep, truck, train and helicopter.  We played on a Navy ship, but it was too windy to play on deck as planned, so we had to move below deck to perform in a room that wasn’t nearly large enough to hold all the sailors who wanted to come to the show.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/61397753&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p>Several of us flew four hours to a small island to play for a Coast Guard station in the middle of the Pacific.  When the plane was unloaded, most of our equipment couldn’t be located, so we improvised a show using whatever instruments were on hand.  We got to tour a submarine.  We were invited to cruise the harbor in the captain’s cruiser in Japan.  And to this day, I’m still not sure if the captain actually gave his permission for that excursion!</p><br /><br /><p>Besides the performances, the best part of this experience was getting to see and experience life in faraway lands.  From sitting at the table where the peace talks were held between North and South Korea in the DMZ, to being invited to attend a traditional Japanese wedding ceremony.  From touring beautiful castles along the Rhine river to learning to dance the polka in a tent at the German-American Volksfest in Berlin.  Being part of USO Shows is something I will always remember and be thankful for. </p><br /><br /><p>As part of the UMKC Accordion Orchestra, I’ve also gotten to travel and perform in at least a dozen more countries.  One of my favorite memories was when we were in Moscow, which was still part of the Soviet Union at the time.  We shared a concert with a Russian accordion orchestra.  Our groups had exchanged music in advance so that we could play with them on a Russian piece, and they would play with us on an American piece, then we would split the rest of the concert.</p><br /><br /><p>During the rehearsal, I turned to the accordionist sitting next to me.  He didn’t speak English, and I knew only a few Russian words.  We managed to converse in German, but the blending of the two groups in concert showed that music is indeed the international language.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/61397755&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How long have you been a songwriter? Describe your creative process.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I never ever dreamed I would be a composer.  Growing up taking accordion lessons in Albuquerque, New Mexico, I never wrote a song.  During four years at the UMKC Conservatory, I never wrote a song.  I never thought I had that gift.</p><br /><br /><p>In 2000, I started playing for nursing homes, seniors groups and retirement communities.  I needed a song as an opener for my program.  A symphony conductor/ composer from New Zealand, Gary Daverne, had once shared with me how he sometimes takes a person’s name or a phrase, then converts the alphabet to musical notes to come up with the melody for a song.</p><br /><br /><p>On February 22, 2002, I had been to the eye doctor for my annual exam.  Since my eyes were dilated, I couldn’t see to do any paperwork.  I decided to get out my accordion and play something since it was the anniversary of my first accordion lesson.  I remembered Gary’s technique and ended up writing my first song, “I Love Playing Accordion.”  I’ve used that song ever since as the opening piece for my programs for seniors.  And yes, I really do love playing the accordion!</p><br /><br /><p>During my programs for seniors, I reminisce a bit about things like “Do you remember roller skating or riding a bicycle in the springtime?” or “Do you remember coloring Easter eggs?” or “What was your favorite Halloween candy?”  These childhood memories have also been the inspiration for songs. </p><br /><br /><p>Sometimes I wake up with a tune in my head.  I keep a small digital tape recorder handy and hum the notes or sing the words into the recorder so I can work with them later.  I’ve recently started using my iPhone to catch moments of inspiration since my digital recorder only holds 99 snippets, and it’s full.  With all the hats I have to wear as an independent musician:  performances, marketing, publicity and social media, it’s sometimes hard to find time to focus on song-writing.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/61397759&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Your music has a multigenerational appeal. Tell us more about how you adapt your musical approach for different audiences.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>As I started writing songs, I would try them out during my performances for seniors.  It came as a complete surprise to me that my songs ended up being children’s songs.  When I finished my children’s CD, <em>Come Sing Along with Janie Next Door</em><em>™</em>, I started playing for preschools in order to market the CD. </p><br /><br /><p>Seniors seem to enjoy my children’s songs because they are reminded of their childhood, or of experiences with their own children and grandchildren.  Kids seem to enjoy my music because I have them participating in the performance, marching, singing along, dancing, clapping their hands.  No matter what age group I’m playing for, my goal is for the audience to have fun with the music.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/61397741&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What advice do you have for people who want to do what you do?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Be prepared to work hard.  If this was easy, everyone would be doing it.  I have put a lot of time and effort into being a professional musician:  years of music lessons and education, as well as hours upon hours of practicing and memorizing music.  And now that I have a CD out, I’m learning about the business side of the music industry:  sales, publicity, marketing and social media, things that I’m hoping will take me to the next level of my music career – whatever that may be. </p><br /><br /><p>Having said all that, if you have a passion for something, whether it’s playing the accordion, or writing songs, or painting or writing books, follow your passion, and dream big.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Jane's recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>At the top of my book list has to be “<a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/311266036_the_annotated_anne_of_green_gables"">Anne of Green Gables.</a>”  I love the Anne of Green Gable series of books by L.M. Montgomery with the smart, auburn-haired (not red!), always-well-intentioned- but-frequently-in-a-pickle, Anne Shirley.  I have read all the books several times and was delighted when PBS offered Anne of Green Gables as a tv series, which is available on DVD.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>I really enjoy Steve Berry’s books.  One of his books is “<a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/591645036_the_templar_legacy"">The Templar Legacy</a>.”  Somewhat like Dan Brown’s “<a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/414307036_the_da_vinci_code"">The DaVinci Code</a>,”  which I also enjoyed, there is a mix of international settings, history and a chance to ponder, “Could something like this really have happened? ” </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Another favorite author is Vince Flynn and his thrillers.  I’ve read every one of them – the most recent was “<a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1194315036_the_last_man"">The Last Man</a>.”  What I like about them is that the main character may be anywhere in the world, but he always manages to survive whatever is thrown at him, sometimes not quite by the rules, but he gets the job done and saves the country.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>My all-time favorite movie is “<a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/475973036_the_sound_of_music"">The Sound of Music</a>,” starring Julie Andrews, my all-time favorite singer.  The scenery, the music, the characters.  I find myself singing along with the Von Trapp Family every time I watch the movie.  The bonus material on a second DVD was really interesting to me as well, learning about the real Von Trapp Family, the real Maria and seeing behind-the-scenes clips of what it was like filming the movie in Salzburg, Austria.  (I drove my friends crazy for weeks with Sound-of-Music trivia after watching the bonus DVD!)</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>It’s hard for me to pick favorite CDs as I enjoy so many different styles of music.  The movie “<a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/416282036_chicago"">Chicago</a>” has a great CD soundtrack that I have listened to so many times that it should have been worn out by now.  Another favorite CD is the music of the Vince Guaraldi Trio on “<a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1200979036_a_charlie_brown_christmas"">A Charlie Brown Christmas</a>.”</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /></div>","0","437","1","1431017655","1492636667","0","0","Eclectic","accordion|children's music","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/jane-christison","",""

I've been writing lyrics since I was able to put sentences together. I play guitar, ukulele, cello, and sing. I am an assistant teacher of basic guitar and ukulele at Rocker's Music Lessons (currently, operating out of The Great Mall of The Great Plains in Olathe). I've been singing, pretty much, since I could talk, playing the cello since fifth grade, guitar since sixth grade, and I started on the ukulele about a year ago. After one of my performances at Groundhouse Coffee- I was approached by Michael ""Seven"" Summers, who is a producer at Strange Music in Lee's Summit. Strange Music is Tech N9ne's label, and they are looking to expand their base beyond rap by engaging with songwriters and performers of different genres. I have, recently, started working with them by writing ""hooks"" on forthcoming singles that are being produced for artists on the label.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/185910253&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Where have you performed?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I started at a place in Overland Park called The Refuge. Unfortunately it has since closed. Through Rocker's- I played a couple songs at Groundhouse Coffee in Gardner, I did a short set outside Mildred's Coffee Bistro in KC for First Friday in September. I've also played Homer's Coffee House in downtown Overland Park, Black Dog Coffee in Lenexa, and Old Shawnee Pizza in Shawnee, KS. I have future gigs scheduled for Great Day Cafe in Overland Park, and Holy Cow Market and Music in KCMO.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Describe your songwriting process. </strong></p><br /><br /><p>I usually start with some random chords and a rhythm I like and then I just sing on top of it. Really, whatever comes out of my mouth until I come to an idea for lyrics that I like. Then I build that idea and just keep singing until I have some good lyrics. Once I've got the lyrics down, I play around with the guitar part a little more. I like songs that speak to me, and I can relate to their message- So, I write songs with that purpose in mind. I want my music to speak to others, and I want them to relate to the lyrics.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/185910248&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How do you balance school with songwriting?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>School always comes first. Homework is my first priority when I get home. After that, I block out time to practice my instruments. I play cello in the Olathe East Concert Orchestra- so I need to practice my scales and pieces that are in upcoming performances. Songwriting, and music in general, is a very important part of my life. At school, we actually have block scheduling. On Thursdays, we start later than usual- so I bring my guitar, grab a practice room, and try to write and/or jam with some fellow students. We also have a study hall on Thursday- so, unless I need extra study time, I do the same thing.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Who are your musical influences?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I would say my greatest musical influences are Sara Bareilles, Death Cab for Cutie, Priscilla Ahn, John Lennon, Colbie Callait, Christina Perri, Iron and Wine, Never Shout Never but my music is also influenced by the books that I read and the people around me.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/185910245&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How did you get involved with Tech N9ne’s upcoming album “Special Effects”? and What’s the nature of your collaboration?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>In August of 2014, while participating in a recital of students and instructors at Groundhouse coffee shop in Gardner, KS - I was approached by Michael ""Seven"" Summers, a producer at Strange Music.</p><br /><br /><p>Initially, he discussed the prospect of having me write songs for the daughter of Travis O'Quin (the co-founder of the label) and a band that was yet unsigned.</p><br /><br /><p>Nothing had come about with the co-writing, but Mr. Summers approached me about writing a hook for Stevie Stone, a rap artist on the Strange Music label. We went back and forth, but the project got put on a back burner- so they could finish Tech's album.</p><br /><br /><p>Mr. Summers contacted me again, and asked if I would try writing a hook for Tech himself. They were running out of time, and they still wanted to add a couple songs to the album. I wrote and home recorded a demo of the hook, and it was presented to Tech. He loved it- so I went into Strange Music's studios in December, and recorded the vocal track. I was told that it is slated to be released as a single, and they're going to make a video of it in April.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/3SXWNgJpZcM?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What will you be performing at the Let’s Get Creative program on April 11?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>""You Hold The Power"": my song about having self confidence and a sense purpose, but offering friendly support for time when it seems all else has failed.</p><br /><br /><p>""And People Will Remember"": is about how inner beauty is more important- and what people will remember.</p><br /><br /><p>""Pieces"": my song about how we're all pieces in a puzzle- different, but needing to get along- so we can fit together.</p><br /><br /><p>and until I write a better closing song..</p><br /><br /><p>""My Happiest Days"" - originally written during the GRAMMY Music Revolution Project as a way to tell my fellow participants how much fun I had, and how I would be sad to see it end- but now I use it to close because each occasion that I get a chance to play is so enjoyable- that I don't want them to end.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/P6hKTyY8eCI?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Kate's recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1325814036_lets_get_lost"">Let's Get Lost</a> by Adi Alsaid</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/846821036_the_hunger_games"">The Hunger Games</a> by Suzanne Collins (the movies too)</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Roth%2C+Veronica%22&search_category=author&t=author"">The Divergent series</a> by Veronica Roth</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1150239036_the_fault_in_our_stars"">The Fault in Our Stars</a> by John Green (Any John Green book).</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/169218036_oliver_twist"">Oliver Twist</a> by Charles Dickens</p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1427662455","1484778789","0","0","Singer - Songwriter|Folk - Americana","guitar|folk|singer-songwriter","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/kate-rose","",""

A duo since 2011, Jime and Aaron have toured widely both domestically and internationally. The music they create together is a true cultural hybrid of lyrics sung in English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Guarani, combined with elements of Jazz, Blues, Rock, Classical, Latin, and Country. It's a pleasure to welcome Jime and Aaron to Listen Local.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourselves. With such diverse backgrounds, how did you unite as a duo in Kansas?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Jime</strong>: My name is Jime and I am from Paraguay. As part of the duo, I play the guitar, the ukulele and the piano. I am also the singer/songwriter. I moved to the US in 2011 to pursue my musical career. At the time I was living in Topeka KS and going to Washburn University. At night, I would always try to go to jam sessions and get up on stage and play. On one of those nights I happened to be a this awesome band's concert. They sounded really good and besides the awesome vocals I was really impressed by their bass player. After the gig I made a point of taking to Aaron and let him know how great he was. In the months to come we would bump into each other and always play on stage. I really like Aaron's style as well as his personality. One day after jamming he said: I would like to be your bass player. I was really flattered and that was the beginning of Jime & Aaron in 2011.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Aaron</strong>: My name is Aaron and I am the bass player for Jime & Aaron. I play electric and upright bass. I was born and raised in Kansas City (KS) and started playing music ever since I was a teenager. I went to school for music education at Emporia State university. In 2009 I joined the 312th Army Band and have had the privileged to be part of this amazing band ever since.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/MIQ2n2nL-pE?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe the nature of your musical collaboration. Who writes the music, the words, and how do you agree on a “finished product”?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Jime:</strong> I will usually write the foundation of the song: the melody and the lyrics. Once I have something decent Aaron will usually jump in and add his collaboration to the song. This sometimes includes the bass line or modifying melodies, rhythms, etc. We agree on a finished product once we are really content with the song. This comes after  trying many different things and agreeing that this is the best possible version.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>You both have toured extensively, both as a duo and separately. Where are your favorite places to perform and why?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Aaron:</strong> I think outdoor gigs are my favorites. People are there to relax and have a good time and we're adding to the experience. I also enjoy the smaller and more intimate venues where you get to connect deeper with your audience; they get to know you better and you get to know them better as well.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Jime:</strong> I definitely enjoy playing at music venues more than anything. Coming from a very warm culture, I really enjoy playing in South America. My two favorite concerts took place in Asuncion (Paraguay) and Montevideo (Paraguay). I have to admit that I love playing in the US as well because people are so reactive and supportive of our music. We live for our audience, so anytime a person is there to hear us play that's already a great gig.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/ewEDQIFPOfE?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <div class=""widget_iframe"" style=""display:inline-block;width:380px;height:320px;margin:0;padding:0;border:0;""><iframe class=""widget_iframe"" src=""https://www.reverbnation.com/widget_code/html_widget/artist_2679597?widget_id=50&pwc[design]=default&pwc[background_color]=%23333333&pwc[included_songs]=1&pwc[photo]=0%2C1&pwc[size]=undefined"" width=""100%"" height=""100%"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no""></iframe><div class=""footer_branding"" style=""margin-top:-5px;font-size:10px;font-family:Arial;""><center><a href=""https://www.reverbnation.com/band-promotion/promoteit?utm_campaign=a_features_promote_it&utm_medium=widget&utm_source=HTML5_Player&utm_content=widgetfooter_Learn how to get your music heard at ReverbNation.com"" target=""_blank"" style=""text-decoration:none;color:#444;"">Learn how to get your music heard at ReverbNation.com</a></center></div></div>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What do you struggle with the most creatively and how do you push through those struggles?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Aaron:</strong> For me the struggle comes from not sounding original when I am trying to write. There is so much that has already been done musically that it is hard to come up with something that is fresh. I push through those struggles working hard on them, collaborating with Jime in the creative process to give life to something completely new.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Jime:</strong> My main struggle with creativity is time. When I sit and play I can finish a song in a matter of an hour or two. With the working schedule and family time it is very hard for me to find this time. I wish I could spend more time writing lyrics and melodies, I know many songs could come out. Even with a busy schedule I need to find some minutes to create and I am certain that eventually that will pay off. I also feel like melodies are easier for me to write than lyrics. I don't want to have empty lyrics so I spend a lot of time thinking about what to say and how to express it.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/0JZ0ctzYcEw?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Who or what inspires you? How does this relate to the covers you choose to perform?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Both:</strong> Our experiences are what inspire us the most along with our faith. All of our songs are written about something that happened or is happening. There are stories inspired by people that don't know that a song was written for them. This is entirely connected to the songs we cover; some of them are just because we like the melody/lyrics and some because we truly love the stories behind them. We know that people enjoy our original songs much more when we give them snippets of the story behind the song. That also happens to us when we cover some tunes: we read or heard why the artist wrote it and so we load up our cover with a lot of emotions.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Jime and Aaron's Recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1025760036_the_count_of_monte_cristo"">Count of Monte Cristo</a> by Alexandre Dumas</strong></p><br /><br /><p>This is one of our favorite books and stories by far. I have actually read it all and am in love with the characters, the style of writing. Dumas is a genius! I also went to French my whole life so I feel so comfortable with all the French places and names. I fell in love with the movie first and then decided to ready book. Needless to say there is so much more one discovers reading the book. This is such an awesome story! It's hard for me to believe someone can ever create such a masterpiece.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/759000036_war_and_peace"">War and Peace</a>  by Leo Tolstoy</strong></p><br /><br /><p>This is one of my favorite books too. I love Tolstoy as well Dostoievski. What I like the most is the period of time and the stories behind every family, every character. Such an amazing and intense novel. This book too has many French lines that I really enjoy. I always tell myself I need to read it again to refresh my memory; it's a little lengthy though so I'm not sure I will do it. Definitely worth it though.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1029260036_les_misrables"">Les Miserables</a> by Victor Hugo</strong></p><br /><br /><p>This is one of the latest classics I've read. Famous as it is it took me years to actually get to it. This too is one of my favorite stories because of all the emotional implications in the lives of the characters. I am fascinated by the portrayal of the suffering in poverty, loneliness and falling in disgrace. I actually read this one in French. Hugo is also one of my favorite writers!</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/226734036_the_red_and_the_black"">The Red And The Black</a>  by Stendhal</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I found this book easy to read despite the complexity of the story. I read it many years ago and until this day I keep it as one of those books that I'll never forget. I think like the Miserables I also love the French background surrounding the story. I am also very attracted to the shy and poor Julien that arrives to this wealthy family and everything that takes place while living with them. The passion in this book becomes physical it is so real.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/69683036_perfume"">The perfume</a> by Süskind </strong></p><br /><br /><p>This book impressed me by the details on describing smells that the character was so sensitive. Needless to say I did not expect him to be what he was, it was very shocking to discover what he was capable of doing. Very different from the other 4 I've mentioned before, but definitely a one of a kind book.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1429113255","1484778586","0","0","World - Beats|Classical|Blues|Folk - Americana|Jazz","folk|world music","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/jime-and-aaron","http://jimeandaaron.com/","Learn more about Jime and Aaron here."

The brainchild of middle school history teacher Matt Beat and percussionist Steven Beat, Electric Needle Room is Overland Parks's answer to They Might Be Giants, ""Weird"" Al Yankovic, School House Rock and Daniel Johnston. In this edition of Listen Local, Beat discusses writing a song apiece for each and every one of the U.S. Presidents, his disdain for his own lyrics and how he keeps the creativity going. </p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Describe your writing process. How do you manage to stay so prolific with a full-time (7th grade) teaching job?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Usually the melody or hook come first. Fortunately, I usually record the melody or hook into my phone, as they often come to me at random times. The lyrics come later, sometimes years later. Lyrics have always been a bit more challenging for me to write, but I never have a shortage of stuff I want to write about. Lately, with teaching and parenting and all my other jobs, songwriting has taken a backseat, but I still sit down and write whenever I get a chance. I just have to make time, just like with anything else.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/123135219&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You’ve managed to write and record a song about each of the U.S. Presidents (though we’re still waiting for Obama’s). Which was the hardest to write? Easiest?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The hardest to write was the Franklin Roosevelt song. Obviously, he had a long tenure, so trying to cram his accomplishments and the highlights of his Presidency into a few minutes was challenging. Plus, I felt a lot of pressure to get it right because he is one of the most popular Presidents in history. One song that came out easily was the Grover Cleveland one. He is one of my favorite Presidents, and the lyrics came quickly. I had that one done in a day. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What, if anything, do you struggle with creatively and how do you break through that struggle?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Time. I wish I had more time to be creative. Honestly, I see how artists stop creating- they just stopping making the time. We live busy lives, and the real world (not the old reality show- the <em>real</em> real world) can really bring you down. Sometimes, you have to sit down and force yourself to get started, especially if you've been out of the game for awhile. Once you get going though, you remember why you loved your art and wonder what took you so long to get back to it.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/75402703&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Your songs contain a lot of humor and positivity with a healthy dose of self-deprecation, melodies and hooks. Who or what  do you look toward for inspiration?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Everything except the usual stuff songwriters write about. I try not to write songs about love or relationships because there are literally hundreds of thousands of those songs. Instead, I write songs about flossing, valet parking, Wikipedia, Twitter, long nose hairs, eating organic food, Oprah Winfrey, the difference between primary and secondary sources, and tomatoes. I'm currently writing a song about my love of Clif Bars. </p><br /><br /><p>If you look deeply at most song lyrics, they are absolutely horrible. Embarrassingly horrible. I figured, if lyrics are already so bad, I might as well sing about Clif Bars.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/ZUnvmteAxKo?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/123135226&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/54061725&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your recording process. Where and how do you record your music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Recording is my main passion- that's where I feel I can be the most creative and innovative. I record my music in my basement using Logic Pro on my computer. I play all the instruments and sing all the parts and then mix them down together. Sometimes I'm completely a one-man band, but often I will email my mix to my brother, who currently lives in Wichita, to add percussion to them. We have a pretty good system. Occasionally I will record with my friend Ryan Hubener up in the Northland. He has a nice studio in his house that I highly recommend to other local musicians. </p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br />      <div ><div ><br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/0n-03cos56g?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/VbpP_6ICOwk?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />          </div><br /><br />  </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/54061634&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Matt's Recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""http://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1215245036_the_untold_history_of_the_united_states"">The Untold History of the United States</a> by Oliver Stone and Peter Kuzinick</p><br /><br /><p>It's one of the only history books that doesn't look at history through the rose-colored glasses that are caused by extreme nationalism.

A singer-songwriter in the vein of Paul Simon, Bob Dylan and Damien Rice, Davenport will soon embark on a tour of the US, UK, Europe and Australia to support his new album <em>Time, Space and Paperclips. </em>Davenport has roots in Johnson County, KS, and is a mainstay of the Kansas City music scene. For this edition of Listen Local, Davenport talks about upcoming album, his <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1959518176/timespaceandpaperclips"">Kickstarter campaign</a> and his recording process. </p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about yourself. Where do you reside? How long have you been a musician and songwriter?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>	My name is Dane Davenport and I am a singer/songwriter. I grew up in Johnson County and you’ll still find me somewhere around Kansas City playing or listening to live music when I’m not touring. When I was ten I started playing guitar and started writing my own material a few years after that. Slowly over time, music became my career.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/179226163&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/198031243&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your songwriting process. Who or what inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>	There are many different approaches to songwriting and I employ as many of them as I can. Some songs stem from an idea or concept that gets worked and reworked. Then there are songs that come out straight from the gut and I'm rarely aware of the underlaying emotions I had until after I write it. Finally there are the songs that seem to appear in my head fully formed and I just have to write them down. That last kind of song is the rarest but they are often the most special.</p><br /><br /><p>	Countless artists inspire me. Irish singer/songwriters like Glen Hansard and Damien Rice have been some of the biggest. There is something very raw and honest about their performances. Paul Simon has songs I still find new layers to uncover, even after I’ve heard it a hundred or more times.</p><br /><br /><p>	Inspiration can come from anywhere though. People, places, movies, things people said, or what they didn’t say have all seeded ideas for songs. Songwriting is an integral part of who I am. I write constantly and not knowing where your next song will come from is half the fun!</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/198033423&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Where do you perform?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>	Dozens of venues locally, regionally, nationally, and soon internationally.

I love recording live. I have several live videos taken at various local venues up on my website (<a href=""http://danedavenport.com/"">danedavenport.com</a>).

After 5PM, I'm cooking, writing music, playing music with friends, or volunteering with local organizations such as Sigma Alpha Iota, an international women's music fraternity.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/WtxHyA8VZaM?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/98242217&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You have an extensive list of musical accomplishments, including everything from vocal to orchestral works to solo acoustic.

Large instrumental works for orchestra or band and opera are the most technically and practically challenging works to write because there are so many moving parts.

What tools do you use?  How do you break through creative blocks?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Pieces tend to come to me in the form of many disparate ideas, both musical and not, that my mind has grouped together for some reason. Writing the piece tends to be figuring out that reason--the connection between these seemingly unrelated things. For example, my dissertation piece (a trumpet concerto for wind ensemble) brought together quotes from Teddy Roosevelt, museum design and wayfinding, astronomy, dinosaurs, and the trumpet. The connection I found in these things was a human fascination and love of the natural world, which is ultimately what I hope is conveyed through the music.</p><br /><br /><p>Words and text help me so much in working with such an abstract medium as music. I use words to help me find rhythms, melodies, and also general character and feeling. When I feel blocked I first step away and do something else for a bit--I've learned my subconscious mind is much smarter than me and will often figure things out while I'm not looking. Then, I'll go back to concrete ideas and words to help bring me back to the big picture of the piece. That will help me see any places I can easily fix and places that might need some more time to work themselves out.</p><br /><br /><p>I have been experimenting with my process recently, trying to incorporate more improvisation into my work. I love improvising, composing music in real time and being hyper focused and present on my instrument and those playing around me. I am probably more confident walking onstage having no idea what I am about to play than having an entire recital of music memorized and perfected.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" id=""vimeo-104044012"" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/104044012?width=640&height=360&color=00adef&portrait=1&title=1&byline=1&autoplay=0&loop=0&player_id=vimeo-104044012"" frameborder=""0"" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Who or what inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I am inspired by being in nature and learning about science. I also love good stories that make me think deeply about our world. I love listening to podcasts and audio books--I am a very auditory learner, as you might imagine! Podcasts are now so well-crafted and designed they are an art form unto themselves. The good ones give me musical insights into pacing and structure. I also love reading memoirs. They are a good reminder that everyone takes a different path to get to where they are–that capital-S 'Success'–and that I should really just enjoy the journey more.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" id=""vimeo-104012273"" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/104012273?width=640&height=360&color=00adef&portrait=1&title=1&byline=1&autoplay=0&loop=0&player_id=vimeo-104012273"" frameborder=""0"" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Leah's Recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Books</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/336086036_jane_eyre"">Jane Eyre</a> by Charlotte Bronte</p><br /><br /><p>I just finished reading this book (I never had to read it for class), and I couldn't stop thinking about it once I'd finished. Jane is such a strong feminist character, particularly for her time. She is passionate, introverted, and always true to her personal values. I strongly identified with both her strengths and weaknesses.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/122210036_the_remains_of_the_day"">Remains of the Day</a> by Kazuo Ishiguro</p><br /><br /><p>     This was another book that stuck with me long after finishing it. I had so many conflicting emotions about the narrator and loved the way Ishiguro slowly revealed pieces of the story. I like his book Never Let Me Go as well–he uses a similar unveiling narrative technique that really draws me in.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1347634036_yes_please"">Yes Please</a> by Amy Poehler </p><br /><br /><p>I mentioned I liked memoirs–this was one that recently resonated with me deeply. She is full of great advice and stories about being an energetic, creative person throughout her 20s, 30s, and 40s. Poehler writes about being young: ""the pressure of 'what are you gonna do?' makes everyone feel like they haven't done anything yet."" That line really stuck with me.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1193836036_if_you_want_to_write"">If You Want to Write</a> by Brenda Ueland</p><br /><br /><p>This book was shown to me by one of my dearest friends in undergrad and changed the way I thought about composing. This book should be called ""If You Want to Do Anything Creative"". I always come back to it if I am feeling blocked or frustrated with the creative work I'm doing. 3 quarters of a century after publication, Ueland's words remain invigorating and alive! Favorite chapter title: ""Why women who do too much housework should neglect it for their writing.""</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Films/TV</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/340555036_sense_and_sensibility"">Sense and Sensibility</a> - Jane Austen, but particularly the Ang Lee film adaptation</p><br /><br /><p>This is my favorite Austen novel and my favorite movie of all time. I even wrote a piece about it! More than any of Austen's other novels, it is a story about women and their relationships to one another from every generational angle. And Emma Thompson (both her acting and her screenplay) is perfection.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/660321036_stranger_than_fiction"">Stranger than Fiction</a></p><br /><br /><p>Did I mention I like Emma Thompson? In this film she plays a famous author whose current novel ends up coming to life as she writes it. It's my favorite Will Ferrell movie as well. Actually, the entire cast (Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, Maggie Gyllenhaal) is amazing! The story is surreal, a bit whimsical, and very touching.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Music</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1108702036_whokill"">Whokill</a> by tUnE-yArDs </p><br /><br /><p>Funky percussive folk rockers whose content and rough edges get you just uncomfortable enough to make you think deeper into their songs.

Originally from Russia and currently living in Lenexa, KS, Marchenko is a prolific composer of soundtrack and incidental as well as orchestral and rock music. In this Listen Local feature, we learn about the special challenges that come with creating ""soundscapes that match what you see on the screen"" and how writing music for film differs from the other kinds of music he creates and the tools he uses to bring those musical visions to life. </p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. What is your background?  How long have you been a composer?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Mikhail Marchenko. I am a composer and, along with Harlan Ray Knapp, a co-founding member of <a href=""http://www.deflektrecords.com/"">Deflekt Records</a>. I am also a member of a band called The Former. I grew up in a small town in Russia called Pyatigorsk. At the age of thirteen, I moved to Kansas with my mom where I have lived ever since, minus a few years that I've spent studying in Virginia. I have always loved music, even as a kid. I remember listening to Queen on tape and admiring Freddie Mercury's talent and passion for music. I have been composing music for over five years and it all started with a game called Guitar Hero. That game was a gateway for me to pick up and learn the actual guitar. I took a few guitar lessons to learn the basics and slowly started tinkering with Garage Band on my Mac and I am still discovering and learning new things every day. I don't believe that you can come to a point where there is nothing else left to learn, which makes this job so interesting!</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/192068889&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>How did you get interested in writing soundtrack music? Describe the collaborative nature of this work.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>As a musician, I have always admired classical composers like Beethoven or Chopin, however I found that it was easier for me to relate to the work of contemporary film composers, such as Harry Gregson-Williams and Hans Zimmer. The process of writing soundtracks is challenging, yet extremely rewarding. You have to be able to communicate your thoughts and ideas clearly with the director, as well as create soundscapes that match what you see on the screen.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/148631145&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/194052756&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What different creative approach do you take to your non-soundtrack music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The process for me personally is the same - create a catchy melody on the piano or a funky beat and go from there. The main difference between writing music for a film, as opposed to creating beats for hip-hop artists, is that you are not constrained by the barriers imposed on you by the film, which gives you free reign to create any music that you want to create.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/179128350&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How do you and write record your music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I try different variations in melody over the same structure until I find one I like best or one that better suits the scenes. I compose and record my music using a few simple tools - my Mac, a midi keyboard controller, and Logic Pro X. The latter is a digital audio workstation that allows you to record music utilizing the built-in or 3rd party plug-ins.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What do you struggle with the most creatively and how do you push through those struggles?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>All of us have good days and bad days. As Charles Dicken's wrote in A Tale of Two Cities - ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times"". Taking that quote literally, same thing happens when you write music - some days nothing just comes to you and that is quite alright. I struggle with that all the time, everybody does. Yet some days the music just flows out of you. You just cannot let those dry patches define you. I find that, just by getting up and going for a walk outside helps me tremendously when I am in a creative rut.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Who or what inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I am inspired by classical and contemporary composers as well as pop audio producers. I don't think the latter get enough credit for their work, honestly. It is unbelievably difficult to create a catchy melody for one track/artist, but these guys nail it virtually every time.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Mikhail's Recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/45462036_1984"">1984 </a>by George Orwell </strong>- This is one of my favorite novels by George Orwell and by far my favorite dystopian novel full stop.

It's a great story of perseverance and individualism and defiance against a collectivist society.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Films:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/397047036_spy_game"">Spy Game</a>,</strong> directed by Tony Scott - In my humble opinion this is the best spy movie ever made and the soundtrack, composed by Harry Gregson-Williams, is simply amazing.</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/380553036_forrest_gump""><strong>Forrest Gump</strong></a>, directed by Robert Zemeckis - This is a truly great movie that everybody should see.

I guess it wouldn’t be too far off the mark to call myself a composer, though that doesn’t quite get at all of what I do completely, either. Probably just better to call myself a musician, whatever that might mean.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/182292349&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Your work is multifaceted, covering everything from experimental classical to solo percussion to rock (as drummer in the band Riala). What primarily motivates you as a composer?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I would say the main driving factor behind my music is the creation of a thing (a sound, mainly) that I have in my head, that I would much rather have out in the world. Something that didn’t exist before I created it. I find it exciting that any sound I make can evidence my state-of-mind and my surroundings at that specific time. Because a lot of things I’ve written might have taken an entirely different direction if I wrote them now.</p><br /><br /><p>It may seem like a lot of what I take part in musically covers a lot of ground, but I’ve never really thought of it in that way. It’s all the same to me in that I approach all of it the same way. If Nick (singer and guitarist of Riala) brings the majority of a song to practice one day, it’s the same for me writing my drum parts as it is if I’m writing a piano piece. It’s all about taking the initial <em>idea</em>, whether it be mine or someone else’s in the group I’m in, and serving it as best as I can with the tools that I have at the time. I have to be honest with the original idea and myself at the same time. “What strengths can I accentuate or bring out of this that’s already here, that may be hidden? What can <em>I</em> bring to the table that maybe no one else can?” That’s what I ask myself all the time. If I’m playing in the band it’s a lot more improvisation based, I think. It’s a lot of playing a song over and over for a long time; figuring out what works, what doesn’t. It’s a lot of “doing.” We’re all still thinking critically about what we’re doing, of course, but it’s a big free flow of information over a long period of time. There’s a lot more space to bounce ideas around three heads than one.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/116235852&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your creative process. What tools do you use?  How do you break through creative blocks? </strong></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>To tell you the truth, I’m not entirely sure I have a single process. It’s always different. I always carry around a small notebook full of music staves for jotting every idea down if I’m out and about. Looking through it right now, there doesn’t seem to be any common thread between how my ideas are laid out. Some of them are abstract word associations with lots of arrows pointing every which way, some are just a list of the instruments and techniques I would want to use, others are prose representations of what would happen a piece second to second, and some are actual drafts of music.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>I think the musical drafts and fragments, the actual written down things, have been scrapped more than all the abstract stuff. Almost all of them are crossed or scribbled out in some way. I think this is because I didn’t/don’t have a clear idea of what purpose those fragments would serve. Are they a beginning/introduction to a piece? Maybe, but what does that suggest should happen after? I work best when I have a clear conceptual idea of what I want the piece to be about. Sometimes (most of the time) that means sitting with an idea in the back of my head for months or even longer.</p><br /><br /><p>I have a piece called <em>then gently light unfading </em>that’s for a small ensemble of six instruments. It’s about this idea of translation, how the medium of an idea or statement changes the inherent meaning of the statement. Similar to saying something in English and then a literal translation in French. They might say two very different things; the actual meaning of the sentence might change, despite them technically being the same, because of the associations the words might have in the different languages. So in that piece I was exploring that idea with the instruments: how does the fact that a violin need to use a bow change the same set of notes that have just been blown through a clarinet? This piece I could just not figure out how to write. It started out with the instruments it has now, and then it evolved into a chamber orchestra work, and then it became a full symphony orchestra work. But it still wasn’t working for me. Then for some reason, I started looking back at the early drafts (the sextet) and comparing them to the full orchestra version, and they were <em>completely </em>different. They were wholly different pieces at that point, despite their common genesis. The process of writing the piece had mirrored the initial idea! Suddenly I understood how I needed to move forward and was able to finish not just one of them, but both. The orchestra version became <em>unheard footfalls only sound.</em> It took over a year, but now I have two pieces instead of just one. I wrote other things during that time, of course, but those two just needed that much time to cook. So my process is pretty messy, but it seems to work for me if I let everything simmer enough.<br /><br /><br />	 </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/173242391&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Who or what inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Oh man. Everything and everyone! I know so many great musicians and other composers around me that constantly amaze me. My two friends in Riala, for one. So many other local bands on the KC scene. Kansas City just has an air about it right now. There’s a lot of people doing really interesting things. I don’t want to name names here for fear of leaving people out, but: Jorge Arana Trio, Via Luna, Temp Tats, David Hasselhoff on Acid, Janet the Planet, SeaKings, Teri Quinn, After Nations, Monta at Odds, Author and the Illustrator, Bears and Company, Not Like Igor… Just off the top of my head. The thing of it is that’s just the rock-oriented scene. Everything else is booming too. The classical scene, jazz, all of it.</p><br /><br /><p>I’m also very drawn to the non-musical arts as well: painting, sculpture, fiction, poetry. I’m finding most of my inspiration lately from the way other artists work and their ideas about their art form. Like how Richard Serra might deal with space using his giant sheet metal constructions and guide people with their shape and trajectories at certain points. That might inspire me to try to find something analogous in writing music. How might I create a “space” that I can guide a listener on an exploration of, that they can move around in (metaphorically or literally) rather than just drag them down a hallway with a door on the other end?</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=3816435462/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://riala.bandcamp.com/track/aether"">Aether by Riala</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Morgan's recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/349645036_the_shining_dvd"">The Shining</a> --Stanley Kubrick</strong></p><br /><br /><p>    The sense of space in this film is tremendously well done. I've heard from several people that the Overlook Hotel is almost a character in the film and it's true. It's oppressive. People go down corridors that shouldn't exist in relation to the previous shot. It messes with you. It's hallucinatory. I could talk all day about the Grady-Torrence bathroom scene. Not to mention the great use of music in the score: Bartok, Penderecki.</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/357940036_the_body_artist"">The Body Artist</a> by Don Delillo</strong></p><br /><br /><p>    After he wrote Underworld, Delillo scaled way back on the size of the forms he was using, and I think the smaller scale is where he really excels. The events in the later books are ""smaller"" as well, but for me this somehow makes everything more impactful, rather than less. Not to mention that he's one of my favorite sentence-level writers around. It was a toss up between this novel, The Angel Esmeralda: Nine Stories, and Point Omega for which Delillo to recommend, but The Body Artist is so abbreviated, bizarre, and strangely poignant that I couldn't choose another. </p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1087821036_the_captain_asks_for_a_show_of_hands"">The Captain Asks for a Show of Hands</a> by Nick Flynn</strong></p><br /><br /><p>    I picked this up several years ago in a local book store some years ago and was immediately floored by it. As far as subject matter, it is not lightweight at all. It tackles, among other things, the Iraq War and the torture and abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghaib. The way the book creates large scale (book length) form with repetition/variation of smaller forms (poem sized, stanza sized, line sized, a single word) almost seems fractal to me, like looking at constantly smaller versions of something larger. I've set two of Flynn's poems to music, one of which is from this collection: ""Imagination.""</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1227908036_tenth_of_december"">Tenth of December: Stories</a> by George Saunders</strong></p><br /><br /><p>    Great story writer. Funny and weird  that borders on lots of different things. Often tragic, as well. At first, Saunders' world seems so bizarre and far removed from our own, but the longer you read, the more (somewhat scary) similarities you notice.</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1141365036_leaving_the_atocha_station"">Leaving the Atocha Station</a> by Ben Lerner</strong></p><br /><br /><p>    A poet on a Fullbright to Spain spends his time avoiding his project that sent him there and rather contemplates whether or not his work (and, by extension, himself: as a poet and as a person) is fraudulent. There's lots of great thoughts on the nature of art and lots of clever writing.</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1351667036_another_language"">Another Language</a> by This Will Destroy You</strong></p><br /><br /><p>    This band's name is probably the truest thing they could have picked to call themselves by. This album, their latest, seems to be a solid mixture of all their previous work: long ambient interludes, dense climaxes that can sometimes edge to noise (in the best way), and a good grasp of dynamism. Look to their album Tunnel Blanket if you're looking for something a bit longer and darker.</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1246713036_the_terror"">The Terror</a> by The Flaming Lips</strong></p><br /><br /><p>    Similarly, this album's title is probably the truest thing the Flaming Lips could have chosen. This album is a lot like walking through a neighbor's house. You walk in and look around a room. It's a lot like your house, very familiar, but very small things are very different in strange ways. Everything seems neon, but the lights are low, you can't quite tell what the shapes are. You move to another room, one that serves a different function, but you can tell it's in the same house. Each room is almost homogeneous but your perspective to it changes. But then, after a while, you start to think this is all actually your house and that you'll never leave. Or that you won't want to.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1431449655","1484777829","0","0","Classical|Experimental","experimental|classical","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/morgan-greenwood","https://morgangreenwoodcomposer.wordpress.com/","Learn more about Morgan's music here."

How long have you been a musician and songwriter?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I often joke that I sang before I talked. Although I’m not sure how accurate that is, I don’t remember a time in my life when I did not sing. My mother, father, sister, brother and I entertained ourselves by singing—while working, on long road trips or just relaxing around the piano. I sang in church choirs and numerous duets, trios or quartets. My older sister, Ruth, and I sang our first duet in a church in Clarendon, Texas when I was around seven years old. After the first verse, Ruth nudged me and said “sing louder.” Everyone laughed.</p><br /><br /><p>In elementary school and junior high, music and recess were the fun breaks of the day to clear our brains to learn the more boring subjects such as reading, writing and arithmetic. In third grade, my mother taught in a two room country school about 10 miles from Clarendon. Once a week a piano teacher came after school and taught students who signed up for private instruction. Those lessons, a couple of semesters of voice and flute lessons in school and some scattered private lessons as an adult were the bulk of my individual musical training. My fifth grade music teacher in Clarendon taught us the basics of music theory—the names of the notes on the staff, what was meant by key and time signatures, how notes were spaced in a major scale and what notes make up a major chord. We also learned about the I, IV, and V chords, the chordal structure for many simple songs.</p><br /><br /><p>In the Glendale, Oregon junior high band, I played flute one year then moved on the saxophone because it was loud. As a freshman, I then sang in the Glendale high school choir and the girl’s triple trio. My last three years of high school, I sang in the Federal Way, Washington high school choir; in my junior year, I was in the girl’s trio and as a senior in the newly formed 16-voice Madrigal singers.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/216464927&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p>At Wayland Baptist College in Plainview, Texas, I was in the International Choir for two years until I dropped out to take a required course for my major in mathematics. To prepare for our performances and the annual spring tour, we practiced five full days before school began then an hour a day in the fall and spring semesters. At Wayland, I had easy access to a piano—either in the dormitory lobby or in one of the music department’s practice rooms. I could always find an open practice room because invariably, a student assigned to a room wasn’t practicing. For me, it was fun, not practice.</p><br /><br /><p>I bought a guitar in graduate school because that was the first time I did not have access to a piano. My first guitar, a small hand-made 12-string guitar, was hard to play but had a beautiful sound. A house mate sold me the guitar, showed me five or six chords and gave me a guitar chord chart and a Salvation Army song book. I knew all of the songs and a few hours later I could muddle through all of them in a couple of keys. After I finished my MA in math, I took a Folk University (non-credit community) guitar class at the University of Kansas—KU. The class was in the basement of the KU’s Canterbury House, the meeting place for the Episcopal student group. I became a regular at the Friday and Saturday open mike in the Fiery Furnace coffee house in the basement and began playing guitar for the folk mass held once a week at Canterbury House. A flutist often played with me and when I moved to Denver, away from my new-found musical community in Lawrence, I bought a flute and began to play again. I also sang in a church choir and in Denver’s community choir, The Classic Chorale.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/Qw2XhE5o4xM?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p>When I moved back to Lawrence in 1976, a new music community was emerging. There were weekly bluegrass and old time fiddle jam sessions at Off The Wall Hall, a concert hall behind a music store. Those jams started a lifetime love for jamming which have inspired me to hone my musical skills and expand my repertoire to new songs and styles of music. Often musical arrangements emerge spontaneously that are far more exciting than the sum of the parts. Jamming also brings together people of many walks of life and life views, who might be at odds politically or religiously, but enjoy personal connections that come from harmonizing together.</p><br /><br /><p>On Friday or Saturday nights, I often drove to the Foolkiller in<em> </em>Kansas City for folk music concerts and jams after the shows. At the Foolkiller, I was introduced to a variety of new styles of folk music and met other musicians including three women who along with me founded Rosy’s Bar and Grill. We were an acoustic music, feminist group that sang songs about women’s experiences. In the summer of 1978 we took a nine week tour of the West Coast, Canada, Minnesota and Ohio. At the end of the tour, I moved to Kansas City because music was pulling me to Kansas City three or four three or four times a week.</p><br /><br /><p>In Kansas City, I have played in a number of groups. The ones with the most longevity were 1) Rosy’s Bar and Grill, <em>2)</em> The Waffles—a string band folk music group, 3) Wit’s End—a women’s rock ‘n’ roll band and 4) Checkered Past—a folk music string band. I currently perform big band songs, swing, 50s and 60s, country, rock ‘n’ roll, blues, gospel, and more with Karen Hendricks. I also play solo gigs, participate in songwriter’s events and I still jam every chance I get.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>You can play 11 instruments, including the dobro, saxophone and autoharp. How does your approach to songwriting change with each instrument?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I haven’t thought about this much, but a confluence of the sound and ease of fingering on an instrument does influence what melody emerges. Instruments have songs inside them waiting to be unlocked and in my hands, different tunes come out based on my skill level at the time and my mood or my state of mind.  Tunes developed on the fiddle are influenced by bowing variations. Double stops (playing two notes simultaneously) can inspire a raucous hoedown type tune or a sweet country style slow dance tune with built in harmony. The flute, on the other hand, tends to yield happy lilts or soulful blues melodies. When I compose with piano or guitar, the beat and chord structure are the initial focus from which a tune is built. That said, I generally compose on the instrument most readily available. I used mandolin to put together <em>A Russian Miracle</em>—a waltz that I play mostly on the fiddle—because the mandolin was small and non-intrusive enough to play in the back of a van on a road trip. I composed <em>Granddad’s Waltz</em>, also a fiddle tune, on a friend’s piano while waiting for her family to get ready to go out for dinner. When writing the lyrics and melody together, I prefer guitar, piano, ukulele or some other instrument that allows me to play and sing at the same time. Or I may just create a tune along with lyrics without any instrument then layer in chords and rhythm later.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/216437270&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your songwriting process. Who or what inspires you? How do you break through creative blocks?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I don’t have any particular set process. Sometimes a melody just comes to me and later I come up with words for the tune or decide the tune is complete as an instrumental without lyrics. Something I hear or read may trigger a song idea. Once I read a news clip about an elderly woman who slowly drove on the sidewalk on her small-town one-block main street one direction, then drove back on the sidewalk on the other side of the street. A policemen watching her asked her why she did that. She answered, “I never did anything wrong in my life. I just had to know how it felt.” A friend and I built a back story about the perfect life she had lived up to that incident.</p><br /><br /><p><em>The Overtime Blues</em> came after staying at friends’ house while playing music in Wichita, Kansas. I rarely saw my friend that weekend because he was working most of the time. He had a good paying job, so it was hard to turn down overtime, even harder to turn down double time for Sunday, which he could get only if he had already worked overtime that week, and even more difficult to turn down triple pay on holidays, which he could only get if he had already worked overtime and Sunday.  He lamented that he had no time to play music. I wrote the “Overtime Blues” about the dilemma of making a lot of money versus playing music. That particular song has a repetitive refrain and only took me about an hour to write.</p><br /><br /><p><em>The Table</em>, on the other hand, took a lot of planning, thinking and tweaking. I wanted to write a song about quilting to honor my mother who was a quilter. I never got a handle on a song that I thought did justice to my mother or her work. Then a line came to me, “I’m an old table waiting to be sold, made from maple sixty years ago.” Our family had a table; it was the sewing table, the dining room table, the bill-paying table, the game table and the overflow kitchen counter. Mother cut out quilt pieces and sewed them together on the table. So I had the table tell its story of how it was used by the family. <em>The Table </em>took months to assemble. Painting a picture of 60 years family life in three minutes rather than in an epic 20 or 30 verse song took a lot of thinking, writing and re-writing.</p><br /><br /><p>Ah, creative blocks! It is difficult to break through those. Sometimes I just let dry spells be dry and use the time to learn new songs, hone musical skills and stretch my musical abilities to a wider swatch of styles. Other times I force writing discipline and make myself write something—good or bad. Just as treasures are sometimes found in a pile of junk, snippets of good writing can pop up in the midst of disciplined, mediocre writing. As in any creative form, the difference between mediocrity and brilliance is often the culling eye—the ability to recognize what to keep and what to throw away. Two lines that rhyme do not automatically make poetry.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/216436900&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>On top of your musical accomplishments, you are also passionate about math. While the connections between math and music are fundamental, what other connections do you see between math and creativity?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I saw the greatest connections between math and music when I was in graduate school where the math problems and proofs were so far removed from the concrete world that I had to let my mind focus and wander at the same time—to explore possibilities then choose an appropriate path back to a coherent solution. I think those are the critical components of creativity—the ability to flit around and follow spritely paths coupled with the discipline to bring coherence and continuity to those paths.</p><br /><br /><p>There are many connections between the structure of music and geometric sequences, trigonometry and arithmetic. One of the most obvious is the subdivision of measures and beats within the measures and how melody lines are laid out over those beats. That is a study in fractions. The frequency in which a vibration of a sound wave (a cosine wave) hits your ears creates the pitch of the sound. The frequencies of a chromatic scale form a what is known to mathematicians as a geometric series. Starting with any note, if you multiply its frequency by , about 1.06, you get the frequency of the next note in a chromatic scale. The same ratio, , relates the distance from a fret on a guitar to the bridge and the distance of the next fret to the bridge. (This is a simplification of a much more complicated topic, but will do for here.) The cosine waves of more than one note played at the same time create harmonious or dissonant sounds based on how the waves themselves meet up at particular points or don’t meet up at all. The notes of a major triad sound harmonious because their frequencies come together at regular intervals, giving our ear drums momentary rests from frequencies that are not together. When one of the notes is out of tune, the frequencies hit our ears without ever having that resolution. There is a mathematical reason why playing out of tune literally hurts our ears.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/fLP_qHF1soY?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You have performed widely throughout the U.S., including appearances on Garrison Keillor’s Prairie Home Companion. How did this come about?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>It came through a confluence of luck, timing and work. <em>Rosy’s Bar and Grill</em> was an anomaly in that we were all women, we all sang, we all played acoustic instruments and we collected songs—both contemporary and traditional—about women’s experiences. The first time we performed in Minneapolis, our sponsor set up an interview with Garrison Keillor on his local Tuesday morning radio show. Garrison was an autoharp player and he was intrigued that we had two autoharps in our group and were an “all girl” folk music band. We contacted Garrison Keillor when we were planning return performances in Minneapolis and played twice on the <em>Prairie Home Companion—</em>at that time a regional radio show—first at the World Theatre then at the outdoor park, fondly referred to as Lake Woebegone.</p><br /><br /><p>In 1978, <em>Rosy’s </em>toured in California, Oregon, Washington, Winnepeg, Minnesota and Ohio. Prior to booking the tour, we collected names of places to play from traveling musicians and anyone else who had suggestions. We sent out over a hundred letters and booked the tour. After that, we did some regional two to five day trips. After <em>Rosy’s</em>, I did some touring on my own to the west coast and took some regional trips with a group, <em>The Waffles</em>. Full time teaching and math-writing projects finally cut into travel time. Now I am beginning to travel again, playing mostly retirement homes and coffee houses in a 200 mile radius of Kansas City. In December 2014 and January 2015 I broadened my touring radius and played at retirement homes and coffee houses in Lubbock, Texas, Tucson and Phoenix. That is a fun way to be a snowbird!</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/Ucs_VLRCM-o?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Where and how do you record your music? What advice do you have for others who want to do the same?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The <em>Rosy’s Bar and Grill</em> record was recorded in Denver and produced by the folk music record label, Biscuit City Records out of Minneapolis. Biscuit City Records arranged recording time at a studio in Denver. For six days, we recorded from about 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., taking only meal breaks. The recording engineer then mixed the tracks and about a month later we got the final finished version. I enjoyed the recording process and a few years later bought a home recording system that would record 8-tracks on a reel-to-reel tape which I then mixed down to stereo or mono reel-to-reels.  With my equipment, I recorded 1) a solo tape, <em>The Way Back Home</em>, 2) a tape with Woody Bauer (Dresner), <em>Woody and Martha, Spontaneous Composition</em> and 3) a project with <em>The Waffles. </em>Other recording projects in studios include 1) <em>The Waffles</em>, <em>Specialty of the House, </em>2) <em>Wit’s End</em> on a 4-song heads-up tape—all tracks recorded at the same time with no overdubbing and 3) an EP with <em>Checkered Past</em>. I am now finishing two recording projects—a solo project of my own compositions and the other with Karen Hendricks, playing swing, blues, rock ‘n’ roll, country, cowboy, traditional and a few other styles of music.</p><br /><br /><p>My suggestion to anyone wanting to record is to find a way to do it however you can—whether with a sound engineer and professional equipment or with a cell phone. Work on the music so you can play it the best you are capable of with your skill level at the time. Use the recording process not only to produce a product but also to critique and hone your musical skills. If you are paying for studio time, make sure to have arrangements worked out ahead of time. Prior to the recording session, talk to other musicians about their recording process and strategies. Go into the studio warmed up and rested and expect the recording to take much longer than you planned.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1439312055","1484774832","0","0","Singer - Songwriter|Folk - Americana","folk|guitar","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/martha-haehl","https://sites.google.com/site/marthahaehlmusic/","Learn more about Martha's music here."

Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you? </strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Natalya Wren, and I'm a freelance musician and 2D/3D artist.  I currently live with family in Mission, KS as I continue to build up my network.  I'm usually rehearsing with one group or another at least 2-3 nights a week; weekends are busiest for me, as that's when I have my regular gigs.  I play piano and sing at Spirit of Hope MCC in Westport on Sunday mornings, and I sing alto in the Schola Cantorum choir at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception downtown.  Aside from these gigs, I also play weddings and other events - anything for which one might need a singer, pianist, and/or violinist - and I'm working on making quite a lot of knit items and other visual-art projects so I can reopen my Etsy shop in August!</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/113324326&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You’re involved so many different music-related projects – from opera productions and classical  to industrial, soul and sacred music. And you are an established performer as well. How do you maintain a creative focus with everything you do?</strong></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>I feel like my strong passion for the arts is what keeps the focus going for me.  If I'm not actively and regularly involved in several creative projects at once, I start getting depressed and anxious.  Music isn't just therapeutic - it's fuel for me.  It's the currency with which my well-being works.  And I just love so many different genres that it's impossible to choose just one.  It's an outlet for me to explore as many manifestations of the art as I can.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/109529728&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your creative process with songwriting and composition. What tools do you use?  How does collaboration with other artists figure into this process?</strong></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>For my electronic music, I've been using FL Studio [formerly known as FruityLoops] since the summer of 2007.  Often, I'll sit at my electronic keyboard and improvise for 20 minutes at a stretch, either with my ZOOM H2 mic recording it or with a MIDI cable hooking my keyboard up to the laptop, and then I'll listen to the improv and grab ideas from it to work with.  Sometimes music just starts streaming through my head all at once, fully-composed, and I'll have to write it down before I forget it.  This is almost always something that happens when I'm alone and uninterrupted - it's the best time for me to really be able to hear my own thoughts.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Collaborative composition is an entirely different process for me.  I'll be listening to other people while we're jamming and I'll play off of what they have to offer, and I'll find that I'll start writing in a totally different style than what I'm used to.  I think that overall, I do prefer to compose by myself, but I think it's great to be able to collaborate.  It keeps me from getting stuck in one style and having all my music sound the same.  I don't want to be effectively writing the same piece over and over, and surrounding myself with other artists helps this quite a lot.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/130650573&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/131428447&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How do you break through creative blocks?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>What really helps the most is simply to listen to new music.  It can be hard for me to take in new material because of how deeply it affects me, but I find that it's absolutely vital.  It's one reason I throw myself into so many projects - it keeps me from stagnating artistically.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What advice do you have for younger composers?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>It might sound kind of cliché, but don't try to emulate anyone else.  Everyone has influences, of course, but if you're constantly trying to write specifically in the style of someone else, you'll never figure out what YOUR music sounds like.  Don't waste that opportunity to discover who you are as an artist - you're a human being who is just as valuable as any famous person out there!  The same goes for people who are in school for music composition.  Your professors are just there to throw out ideas for you to work with, not to tell you how to write.  Let yourself be receptive to these ideas so you can add more tools to your toolkit, but still remember to take everything they tell you with a grain of salt - it's your art, nobody else's.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Who or what inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I'm inspired by lots of things.  So far as other musicians go - Trent Reznor, Zoog Von Rock [of Angelspit], Steven Wilson, Nivek Ogre [of Skinny Puppy], Frank Zappa, Joni Mitchell, Amy Lee, and Sufjan Stevens come to mind as some of my greatest influences with regards to production, composition, and performance.  I'm also inspired by things as simple as random sounds I hear or images I see - I've been able to improv for 20 minutes on piano just from hearing a tornado siren drill or seeing a picture of multi-coloured clouds in the sky above Norway.  In some instances, it doesn't even take any outside influence - music will just start playing in my head randomly, and I'll have to play it.  It really comes from everywhere.<br /><br /><br />	 </p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/248651036_the_highly_sensitive_person""><em>The Highly-Sensitive Person</em></a>,</strong> by Dr. Elaine Aron</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/205428036_the_downward_spiral"">The Downward Spiral</a></strong></em> - Nine Inch Nails</p><br /><br /><p>In Absentia - Porcupine Tree</p><br /><br /><p><em>Angelspit</em> by Krankhaus </p><br /><br /><p>Enjoy Your Rabbit - <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Stevens%2C+Sufjan%22&search_category=author&t=author"">Sufjan Stevens</a></p><br /><br /><p>Apostrophe (') - <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Zappa%2C+Frank%22&search_category=author&t=author"">Frank Zappa</a></p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1438102455","1484774939","0","0","Eclectic|Electronic|Classical","classical|ambient|industrial","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/natalya-wren","https://soundcloud.com/natalyawrenmusic","Learn more about Natalya's music here."

Walkenhorst released her first album, <a href=""http://unawalkenhorst.bandcamp.com/releases"">Scars</a>, last year, a product of six years of intensive work and development of her craft. For the almost the past year Walkenhorst has been on a tour of the U.S., which she discusses in the following interview she graciously made time for. Fans of Laura Marling, Conor Oberst and Angel Olsen will find much to like in her music. Learn more about her creative journey and listen to some songs from Scars below.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where are you from? Where are you currently? Describe your music. </strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Una Walkenhorst. I was born and raised in midtown Kansas City, Missouri. At this specific moment, I am in a motel in San Diego, preparing for a gig at Lestat's West. However, when you read this, I will most likely be somewhere else. I change cities every week or so, exploring everything I can.</p><br /><br /><p>Describing my music is a bit tricky at this point for me, because everything I've released was recorded over a year ago. ""Scars"" was an accumulation of songs from many, many years. I wrote the song ""Traveler"" when I was 15. I wrote many of the other tracks when I lived in Brooklyn.</p><br /><br /><p>That first album was definitely a bit more upbeat and, in my opinion, a little less sophisticated than the material I've been working on. I am very proud of ""Scars"", but I have taken in so many new places and experiences in the past nine months that it doesn't quite seem relevant to me anymore.</p><br /><br /><p>I think my new songs are a bit heavier. They're more than just poems about silly boys who broke my heart. They're about things that are really important to me. They're about feminism and mental illness and learning to completely own who you are. I'm really looking forward to start slowly releasing some new stuff.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/qm3fk4ro9r4?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Tell us about your first album, “Scars.” How long was it in the making? How and where was it recorded? What did you learn from this experience?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>""Scars"" was technically ""in the making"" since I was 15. I was writing songs long before I actually started playing for people. I decided to use some of the early stuff like ""Traveler"" and ""Wooden Man"", along with some of the newer material I had written at the time. I put the album out shortly after I turned 21, so I guess that album was created slowly over a period of about six years.</p><br /><br /><p>As for the process… I honestly remember very little of it. At the time I was recording, I was working about 70 hours a week trying to raise money for my tour. I also tried out crowdfunding, not knowing how incredibly generous friends, family, and complete strangers would be.</p><br /><br /><p>On days off my dad and I would sit down for a few hours and churn out track after track. It was really simple. A mic, my acoustic guitar, a few other little things added in. It was really fun getting to work with my dad on something that he had raised me to love.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/U2O8aVsW0es?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Last year you embarked on a U.S. tour in support of “Scars.” How did that tour go? What were the highlights and lessons learned?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I quit my job in June of 2014 and on July 8th, I got in my 97 Honda Civic and just started driving. I knew the route I was taking, but I honestly had no idea what I was doing. I went to Chicago, across to the east coast, through Canada, down through Colorado and up to Seattle. Then I worked my way down the west coast, across the southern border, and back up into Nashville. That first leg was five months. It was amazing. I came back to KC through Thanksgiving and Christmas, then headed back out at the end of December. I've been going at it nonstop since then, basically taking my last route backwards.</p><br /><br /><p>As far as memorable events… I can't even begin to describe how chaotic and magical and terrifying it has been. I have met amazing people, stayed in insane places, and learned so much about myself and the world around me. I opened for Happy Traum and John Sebastian in Woodstock, stayed in what was essentially a Canadian art commune in Montreal, and drove across multiple states with an infected kidney. I fell in love with the west coast, I walked through the Redwoods, and I saw dolphins and whales on the beaches of Santa Cruz. I explored dozens of hostels, I slept in my car, and I took in as much as humanly possible.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/E5SsXBfurbU?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your songwriting process. How do you move through creative blocks? Who and/or what most inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My writing process has come to the point where I can't have a ritual or a pattern that I follow anymore. I never know where I'm going to be, I seldom have a quiet place to write, and things are constantly moving. I've had to become more flexible with the way I write. I record audio in my car, just rambling random ideas. I've kept a journal religiously for 9 months. I write every day, even if it's just a few scrawled lines or a string of words that stuck in my head.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/WqnMqLreAMI?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What other Kansas City area songwriters, bands and musicians would you like to give a shout-out to?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I have a complicated relationship with the Kansas City music scene. I never got into much local stuff. I never played locally. I didn't really get into the it, if only because I felt that I would be cheating. I grew up with my dad always playing around town. Everyone knows him. Everyone knows I'm his daughter. I knew that people would do me favors because of that, which was very nice, but I didn't want that kind of attention. I wanted to get gigs because I worked hard and was a good musician. So, I basically spent all of my time in Kansas City cooped up in various apartments, writing as much as I could so that I could head out on my own. So… can I make a shout out to my cat instead? #MrBaby4Life</p><br /><br /><p>﻿*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Una's recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1323911036_upside_down_mountain"">Upside Down Mountain</a> by Conor Oberst  </p><br /><br /><p>One of my favorite albums of all time.

Where do you live and work? What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I live in De Soto, Kansas which is located in the northwestern tip of Johnson County. It's a small and quiet little suburb - mostly small subdivisions, surrounding an unexciting downtown strip. People who live in De Soto have to drive at least fifteen minutes to get groceries or get a decent cup of coffee. I've lived here for my whole life. My family moved here when my dad found a job working as a minister at a church in Lenexa. People who know me know that I go through jobs fairly quickly. I'm currently not working anywhere. School has just started up for me. I'm attending college at Johnson County Community College and I'm enrolled in their Recording Arts Certificate program. I'm also just getting some of the general education requirements out of the way for a Bachelor's program at Musician's Institute of California. A typical day for me right now just includes attending school for 7 hours and then coming home and practicing guitar or hanging out with my amazing friends. I also have a dog named Buster whom I take on walks and watch Netflix with. On days that I'm not going to school, I'm recording music or writing new music.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/186139951&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Tell us about recording your recent single “H.D.Y.F.M.” The production is very sophisticated.

Songwriting wise, I have a little studio in my room, and when I was drumming up ideas I stumbled upon that simple little electric piano riff that you hear at the beginning. Basically that became the basis for the song. I didn't have any lyrics or chords before I started recording it. The song was written as it was being recorded. That's probably not unusual for a lot of people but, for me, I usually write with an acoustic guitar and a notepad so, writing within the framework of an already recorded song was a bit confining and difficult. Regardless of the procrastination, I still ended up spending about 50 hours on the songs with a total of 60 tracks so the tune is by far my best piece production wise. For me, the tune represents what I like to do production wise when it comes to instrumentation, groove, and song structure - keeping things listenable. It ended up earning first place in the conference which was affirming. I'm still not in love with the chorus, and I know that the tune has little merit lyrically - just from a songwriting standpoint. However, that song for me provided some comfort in that it proved that I could produce music on my own that sounded professional.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/219417383&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Can you point to one time in your life where you knew you wanted to be a songwriter? Who or what inspired you early on to create music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I can't point to one time in my life where I knew I wanted to be a songwriter. However, I knew when I wanted to be a guitar player.. I would listen to a lot of wholesome music growing up because of my dad. I can't thank my father enough for introducing me to music like The Beatles, Eric Clapton, and Nickel Creek at a young age. He also plays the guitar so he would always show me chords and I would pick up the guitar every once in a while. Eventually it got to the point where I told my dad that I wanted an electric guitar for Christmas. When Christmas came around I got my wish. I spent hours trying to master the instrument listening to different artists and burning my eyes out online looking at chord charts. However, it wasn't until my dad gave me a ""More Cowbell: Classic Rock Greatest Hits"" CD that I knew I had to play guitar for the rest of my life. I wanted to be the best guitar player in the world and I pushed that through a variety of different outlets.I played in my middle school jazz band and my church's worship band until I decided that I needed to start my own band so I could play guitar the way I wanted to play it. The only adversities I would have to overcome to start my own band would be writing my own tunes with original lyrics and learning how to sing. So I kind of became a singer and songwriter by default and dove in trying to sing and write tunes, when all I really wanted to do was play guitar. Through the process of learning guitar I also gained admiration for other players like B. B. King, Eric Clapton, and John Mayer. Growing up with the internet was awesome because I was able to watch these guys play, and play along side them by watching videos on YouTube; that was a huge inspiration for me.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"" src=""http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=1614021040/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://zacharyburch.bandcamp.com/track/lying"">Lying by Zachary Burch</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your creative process with songwriting and composition. What tools do you use?  How does collaboration figure into this process?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I don't really have a process with songwriting and composition. All I know is that you can't force inspiration. This year has been really difficult and I've struggled with writer's block. Being inspired is a difficult thing. For people who are always creating music it's hard to know when you are really inspired and when you are pushing it. For me, I always have ideas for melodies, chord structures and guitar riffs, and that's something I'm super thankful for. However, it can also be an Achilles heel when it comes to lyric writing. I might have a super amazing melodic idea and chord structure but the lyrics just aren't there. I try to finish the song anyway and it just comes out sounding like dishonest rubbish. What I discovered is that experiencing something real in your life is the best tool for writing real, honest songs that resonate with people on an emotional level. I will always have the ability to convey emotion by playing music without words, but I'll never be able to speak unless I have something worth saying. So my advice is just go experience something and live life like everyone else. Being a musician doesn't give you a badge that makes you relatable and emotional. Go fall in love and get your heart broken. Then once you have something to say don't let the moment get away. Lock yourself in your room until you've written it all down and turned it into something that you love. Those are the tunes that you will love playing and people will keep in their hearts.  </p><br /><br /><p>For musicians, collaboration can be a sore subject because music is personal and we all have huge egos. Collaboration is super helpful as long as you know you can trust the musician's you allow on your tracks. I have been in the process of recording a record for the last year and I've called upon a lot of opinions and help from friends and musician's alike. Sometimes having a second set of ears on your piece is invaluable. Countless times I've thought I knew the right groove for a song going into a session. I get to the session and the drummer lays something down that inspires me to play or sing something differently and it turns out better than what I imagined.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/QsfG_8lsE_0?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Please share a story about moving through a period of creative struggle. What gets you through?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Like I said, I am no stranger to creative struggle. For me, the struggle was in direct correlation to other problems I was experiencing with depression and anxiety. All I can say is don't let yourself become stagnant. Always be getting better and never be comfortable with where you are. If you get to comfortable with the status quo you will never grow or succeed as a person or writer. Go experience something. Get outside of your comfort zone and go live life. Like I said, being a musician doesn't validate you as a human being. If you aren't experiencing life in the same way that your audience is you are never going be able to relate to people with music, or just in general. Writer's block sucks but it's silly to expect to be able to talk about your life if you aren't even experiencing anything besides sitting in your room trying to write a song, and I've made that mistake.</p><br /><br /><p>Here is some of the music that has been inspiring me recently and continues to inspire me.</p><br /><br /><p>James Fauntleroy - ""I Don't Wanna Be Alone"" </p><br /><br /><p>Kwabs - ""Perfect Ruin"" </p><br /><br /><p>Robert Francis - <em>Strangers in the First Place </em></p><br /><br /><p>Blake Bills - <em>Break Mirrors </em></p><br /><br /><p>Nickel Creek -<em> This Side </em></p><br /><br /><p>Chet Faker - <em>Thinking in Textures  </em></p><br /><br /><p>Gabe Dixon Band - <em>Self Entitled </em></p><br /><br /><p>The Paper Kites - <em>States</em> </p><br /><br /><p>Dan Conway - ""Thankful""</p><br /><br /><p>Steffen Schackinger - ElectriGuitaristy</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Zachary's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/320001036_brave_new_world"">Brave New World </a> </strong></em>by<em><strong> </strong></em>Aldous Huxley</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/499925036_a_complicated_kindness"">A Complicated Kindness </a></strong></em>by<em><strong> </strong></em>Miriam Toews</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/291168036_the_war_of_the_worlds"">War of the Worlds</a></strong></em> by H.

His work with KC's premier post-rock band <a href=""https://riala.bandcamp.com/"">Riala</a> is itself noteworthy but Hoyle is also a prolific classical composer, visual artist and collaborator on musical theatre and dance productions. His most recent work is ""To Some Transparent End: A Ballet on a Bus"". For this interview Kalo Hoyle discusses how he makes time to be creative, his inspirations and book, music and movie recommendations.</p><br /><br /><p>* </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Kalo Hoyle and I am a composer and musician in Kansas City where I live and work. I grew up and regularly retreat to my family’s farm in Prairie Home Missouri. While I love KC my heart is most at home far from the city lights.</p><br /><br /><p><br /><br />	<strong>You're a multifaceted and prolific composer and collaborator, in addition to being a member of the band Riala. What do you see as the creative challenges inherent in each of these disciplines?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>It is a definite challenge to find the time to get to work on every project that I’m interested in. Making time for Riala, collaborative works, personal thought-sound experiments and commissions is a task in itself, but the variety of work that I have the opportunity to work on is definitely part of how I overcome the individual challenges of each genre. I see each type of work as an opportunity to make the most of that medium’s assets. When I am trying to share an idea I have that needs physical movement I’ll find dancers to collaborate with. When I am trying to express a deep internal feeling that is an aggressive, direct statement I will often use words or poetry since I find it the best for sharing philosophical meaning without writing a 40 minute opera. Sometimes an idea doesn’t come out in a sound so I will end up having to draw or paint the experience. It all comes down to finding the best medium for the experience I want to share.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/kUdHRwKbgcw?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/249206644&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/221636295&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What tools do you use to compose? What may surprise a listener about how your music is created?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The most important part of working on a piece is taking incredible long walks! There are not many streets between 35th and 70th I have not passed through, always singing and noise making, planning out my sounds and concepts that I can then go and write out. After this process I will do lots of research on music others have made that I can learn from. I then write out basic visual sketches of the music and notation on paper and when it is no longer incredible vague I’ll take this and build it in Finale (a music notation software).</p><br /><br /><p>If I am collaborating with someone I will try and spend time with that person, talking about the work and sharing ideas and parts that I have made demos of. I tend to use about a third of the material I’ll write for a work since my process usually involves writing all my ideas and then taking the good parts out.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Who really inspires you as an artist?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My inspiration tends to be specific to the project. If there is anything consistent with me I would say it is an absolute reverence for folk music from every corner of the earth. I was raised on American folk music and being aware of its unique direction I began to explore music from all over the world. My favorite part is it allows me to never get bogged down, worrying about being original. If you look long enough you will find a tribe in some remote place that came up with your idea 1,200 years ago.</p><br /><br /><p>The second aspect of my music I always reach towards is creating art that allows people to ask questions. Right now I am working with my good friend Mark Lauer on composing a bassoon work for one of his upcoming projects that tries to look at the relationship between sound, language, story, and when we cross between these different places. Many of my experimental works fall into this realm, being more question than art.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/n9FAzt1KvlE?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/25601053&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you the most about the Kansas City music community?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The most inspirational thing about Kansas City is the astounding variety of artists working here, collaborating with people from all walks of life.

We are fortunate to bring you an interview with the entire band (which also includes Chris Hutchings on bass and Hughes Pope on drums), in addition to their book, music and movie recommendations.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourselves. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Mitch –</strong> Matt “Mitch” Mitchell, guitars. I live in the Northeast with Val. We are married in real life. I work at Musician’s Friend Private Reserve Guitars at the MF warehouse in KCMO off 210 and 291 as a guitar tech.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Val: </strong>Valorie Engholm, I’m married to Mitch and live in the Northeast. I work as an instructional designer and am in grad school for my master’s in Education. In addition to that, I’m am also a candidate for Missouri State Rep. in my district.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Chris: </strong> From KCMO-  Bass - I own and operate a martial arts studio in Waldo called the Chuan Fa Martial Arts Academy.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Hughes:</strong> I live just off Red Bridge Rd and I play the drums. I’m actually still in school at JCCC but I am planning on becoming a Paramedic.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Your first album <em>Plastic Heart </em>was released in May.  What are you learning about the recording process that you’ll take to future projects?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Mitch – </strong>We recorded the album in our house. It’s a completely DIY project. We’ve all had experience recording and producing before both professionally and DIY.  So the recording came pretty natural to us. We live in an old house with plaster walls and “actual” 2”x4” construction and high ceilings. So the house lends itself to awesome recording sounds.</p><br /><br /><p>The biggest struggle, and I would say, the biggest learning experience we had was mixing the record. I had a sound in my head and the recordings we had just weren’t matching that. Finally, when we were about to give up and start from scratch, the sound of the record presented itself. It spoke to us. Trying to match the sound in our heads was the problem. Once we found the sound, it was easy sailing from there.</p><br /><br /><p>So, for me, learning to trust  the music to speak to you instead of trying to wrestle a particular sound was my biggest learning experience from Plastic Heart.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Val: </strong>I really do love the recording process. When I go back and listen to our album, though, I keep saying to myself “I could have performed that better” or “that was a little off”. I’m such a perfectionist! In the next project, I’m gonna try to take it a little easier on myself. Also, I love the DIY approach we took to it, and I don’t know that I’d want to do it any other way.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Chris - </strong>This album was recorded in Val and Mitch's living room. I've recorded in a few different settings ranging from a really expensive studio to a mid level studio and a few projects the way we did <em>Plastic Heart</em>. I enjoy the freedom of recording this way as technology has allowed us to record at a reasonable level of production value. I think the biggest thing to take away from this particular experience is how important the final mix is. Recreating the collective tightness of playing live to a recording is a tough thing to do. I think we did a pretty good job, and will most<strong> </strong>definitely improve going further.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Hughes:</strong> I am actually a pretty new addition to Electric Orchids, and wasn’t really around yet for the recording of <em>Plastic Heart</em>, though I have worked in the studio before quite extensively and greatly look forward to working in the studio with Electric Orchids</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2792830154/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=4225350721/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://electricorchids.bandcamp.com/album/plastic-heart"">Plastic Heart by Electric Orchids</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe the band’s creative process.  What tools do you use?  Who brings what to the table?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Mitch – </strong>We’re all songwriters so we each bring stuff to the table. Val writes all of the lyrics and vocal melodies, so usually one of us will either have a riff to bring to practice, or we’ll just jam out on something until we hammer it out. Then, once Val writes the lyrics, we’ll arrange the instrumental song to fit the lyrics.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Val: </strong>As a keyboardist, I just try to follow along with what the guys are jamming. Or sometimes I’ll come up with a little ditty on the keyboard and they guys will follow suit. As for lyrics, I’ve been writing lyrics since I was very young, and I’ve never been able to do it in front of other people. It’s like showing pieces of my soul. We’ll come up with a structure and I’ll sing out a melody, but then go somewhere alone to write the lyrics. I want to make sure they’re just right before I share them with other people.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Chris: </strong>We kind of have a wing-it style of writing. One of us comes with a idea and we generally build it collectively from there.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Hughes:</strong> Well, from what I’ve seen so far one member will come up with an idea and the rest of us work together and build on the original idea. Usually, writing songs can be quite an ordeal but if you get the right musicians together, then everything comes out naturally almost like breathing, and I think that's we have as a band; Musical compatibility.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>What artists do you look to these days for inspiration? What do you admire most about these artists?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Mitch – </strong>Right Now I’m sort of torn between 60’s surf and psychedelia and modern Indie rock. I also listen to a lot of jazz, but I’m not sure how much of that comes through in Electric Orchids.</p><br /><br /><p>My biggest inspiration right now is St Vincent. I love her complete and total lack of inhibition, both in her songwriting, and her live performances. If she needs to dive into the crowd during a guitar solo, so be it. Crazy light shows and makeup, so be it. If a song calls for a wind ensemble or a crazy fuzzed out guitar, so be it. No rules, no limitations. Plus she’s a great songwriter and guitarist, so that doesn’t hurt.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Val: </strong>Regina Spektor, Apples in Stereo, David Bowie. I really love Regina Spektor’s voice and how she’s unafraid to break taboos in music and prove that you don’t have to be formulaic. Apples in Stereo are just really funky to me and love how fun they are. And I really identify with Bowie’s lyrical style and how much of himself he puts into them. Also, The Beatles have always been an ever-present inspiration musically in my life. They really transcend genre, and love that about them.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Chris:  </strong>My inspirations for music haven't changed much over the years. Sonic Youth, Pixies, Zeppelin, Nirvana, early blues and jazz, and old country like Hank Sr., Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, as well as hip hop, Beastie Boys, Dead Prez, Snoop Dogg. As a fan of many different styles of music it really depends on the day what song or style inspires me.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Hughes:</strong> Nirvana has always been a huge influence for me as a musician. Dave Grohl’s heavy hitting in particular as a drummer. I have always had a bad habit of breaking cymbals, sticks, and heads, and a lot of that comes from Grohl’s influence. Other than that, I’ve always enjoyed bands such as The Pixies, Chevelle, The Shins, and Bring Me The Horizon, honestly there are so many bands that inspire me that it would be pointless to try and list them all!</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2792830154/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=3903923693/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://electricorchids.bandcamp.com/album/plastic-heart"">Plastic Heart by Electric Orchids</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you the most about music in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Mitch: </strong>I love the spirit of Kansas City’s scene. Guess what, New York and L.A. aren’t calling and we don’t care. We’re making the Kansas City scene for Kansas City, not anyone else. No one is looking to the coasts or Nashville or anywhere else for validation. We have all the validation we need right here.</p><br /><br /><p>I also love how cooperative the scene has become. And I don’t think it’s any surprise to anyone to say that it wasn’t always that way. KC musicians understand that when one of us has success, all of us do. And we support each other and cheer each other on. It’s awesome!</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Val: </strong>Kansas City has some really unique music. We have a pretty strong art community here, and a lot of that trickles through into the music scene. I’m really inspired by the creativity that Kansas City musicians have shown.</p><br /><br /><p>I also have noticed that in other cities, bands tend to be in competition with each other, bragging about the different venues they’ve played, or how great their gear is or how they scored a huge gig with some festival. But in Kansas City, we all support each other. If someone plays a really big show, we’re proud of them, not jealous. When someone gets their gear stolen, the community rallies around them to try and get it back. If someone puts out a new album, we’re happy for each other. That makes Kansas City really stand out, I think.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Chris:</strong> The Kansas City music scene has so much potential. This being my favorite city to live in I'm optimistic the culture of original music will continue to blossom. I feel there are really great artists in KC and they are all influenced in part by the rich blues and jazz scenes that made the city famous back in the day.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Hughes:</strong> I actually just moved here all the way from Georgia, but the music scene here was so amazing and I can even almost say intimate, that I instantly felt at home here! I felt kind of lost and confused after the move so I took a quick drive to Westport and ended up going to three different local shows, each of them just as amazing as the last. I’ve been to a lot of places, and gone to a lot of concerts, but absolutely <em>nothing</em> even remotely compares to the local music scene right here, in Kansas City.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2792830154/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=1220426741/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://electricorchids.bandcamp.com/album/plastic-heart"">Plastic Heart by Electric Orchids</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Book and film recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>	<em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/704387036_that_thing_you_do"">That Thing You Do</a></strong></em> : This film should be mandatory viewing for any musician. It really nails the group dynamics. Everyone has a different point of view and a different agenda. Dell Paxton's sage advice: ""Ain't no way to keep a band together. Bands come and go. You just got to keep playing. No matter with who.""</p><br /><br /><p>	<em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/349478036_high_fidelity"">High Fidelity</a></strong></em>: This book fits so much life; love, self-hatred, relationships and music all together in a way that is terminally funny but also incredibly inspiring. Maybe the perfect book about music fandom too.</p><br /><br /><p>I highly recommend that anyone with any interest in rock and roll watch <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/355934036_this_is_spinal_tap"">Spinal Tap</a>.</strong></em> It is a mockumentary about a metal band who goes on tour to promote their latest album. I think it's important for musicians to laugh at themselves and not take anything too seriously.</p><br /><br /><p>I also recommend reading Fargo Rock City by <strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Klosterman%2C+Chuck%22&search_category=author&t=author"">Chuck Klosterman</a></strong>. It's a memoir about growing up in a small town in North Dakota and loving 80's glam metal. It is hilarious, and I identify with it because I was also a teenager in a small town once, completely obsessed with music. Although, for me it wasn't 80's glam metal, but 90's grunge and alternative rock. It's a must-read for music lovers regardless of their favorite genre.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Non music related:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/643773036_the_big_lebowski"">The Big Lebowski</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/424916036_pulp_fiction"">Pulp Fiction</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/516352036_field_of_dreams"">Field of Dreams</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/66246036_the_i_ching"">I Ching, Or, Book of Changes</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/994463036_the_art_of_war""><em><strong>Art of War</strong></em> </a>by Sunzi</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/658223036_the_hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galaxy"">Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></strong></em> by Douglas Adams</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1292291036_slaughterhouse-five"">Slaughterhouse 5: Or, the Children's Crusade, A Duty Dance With Death</a></strong></em> by Kurt Vonnegut</p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/3D_1.jpg"" width=""960"" height=""720"" alt=""Electric Orchids"" title=""Electric Orchids"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2792830154/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1220426741/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://electricorchids.bandcamp.com/album/plastic-heart"">Plastic Heart by Electric Orchids</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1477327844","1484926934","0","0","Rock|Indie|Alternative","indie pop","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/electric-orchids","https://electricorchids.bandcamp.com/","Hear from music from Electric Orchids here."

A songwriter since the age of sixteen, Cedd's musical connection with Kansas City runs deep and he performs often in and around the city. We are fortunate to share an interview with the artist himself and introduce you to his music and book recommendations. Enjoy!</p><br /><br /><p>* </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Hello, my name is Ceddrick Newsome aka Cedd the Light. I live downtown Kansas City, Missouri, and I'm a self-employed musician, singer, songwriter.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>On your website you state that you’ve been writing songs since age 12. What were those earliest songs about? Did you also perform those songs in public?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I've been writing songs since I was 16 years old and a lot of those songs were love songs and inspirational . I started playing the piano when I was 12 and singing since I was 9 years old. I've performed publicly basically all my life.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Talk about how your songwriting process has changed over time. How do you record your music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>When I first started writing I was writing  R&B music. Then I started moving into other genres using different styles which in turn created a crossover style. What cross-over means is using every style of music to perform and relay your feelings to yourself and the world. I record my music right in my own home using Garage Band now I've moved to Logic Pro, a program inside of Apple.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/AH5aDDDvKoo?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How does the music you love influence your songwriting? What are you currently raving about?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The music I love is all styles of music and it influences me to write openly and freely, shows me not to be boxed in and to relate to people on all levels no matter ethnic background or religious background. I believe I meet people right where they're at. And I'm always raving about positivity and motivation and inspiring people to not give up and keep moving forward.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What makes Kansas City a great place for music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>What makes Kansas City great for music is the diverse city that Kansas City is. We are in the Midwest, we are in the heart of the United States and I believe we come from the heart when we express our music. We have a wide variety of artists who are gifted and talented and it stems from being in the heart. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/UWvaxCHaWLs?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Ceddrick's book recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong>Wisdom of the Mystic Masters</strong></em> by Joseph J Weed</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><em><strong>Egyptian Yoga</strong></em> by Muata Ashby</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><em><strong>The Business of the 21st Century</strong></em> by Robert T.

It's a pleasure to share his music and an exclusive interview on Listen Local.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Bobby Yarsulik, and I am a pianist/composer/producer. I'm a husband, a father, a full-time worker, and a part-time student. I live near downtown Olathe with my wife Maci, who is my high school sweetheart, and our 3 year old daughter Aaralyn. I work at TVH Parts Co. in Olathe as a motion graphics designer/videographer in the marketing and advertising department.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Delve into the different kinds of music you write. There’s everything from straight-up power-pop to more somber electronica with some classical elements throughout your work. Who are your influences?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>In general, music has always been a big part of my life. My grandmother on my mother's side was a multi-instrumentalist, and when I was old enough to remember (because she had slowed down eventually), she would always play the piano for me a bit. She definitely was my initial influence to grow as a musician. Stylistically, I think I really came into my own after getting into Ben Fold's <em>Rockin' the Suburbs</em>. I was completely obsessed with that album when I heard it, and it is still my all time favorite (next to Coldplay's <em>X&Y</em>). On the other end of the spectrum, I grew up around two older brothers whom were 6 and 10 years older than me. Being around them I was exposed to things like Primus, Metallica, Tool, NIN, and etc. I definitely gravitate towards a little bit of all of those when it comes to influences as I do indeed play around with many types of genres when I am composing.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/CVfSCSCeOs8?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=1550307841/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://bobbyyarsulik.bandcamp.com/track/pkgo-the-server-is-down"">PKGO The Server Is Down by BSlick</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How do you record your music? Do you play all the instruments? What tools do you use?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I have a small home recording setup in the basement of our current Duplex. When it comes to physical hardware, I have a windows PC, a Scarlett 2i2 interface, a pair of KRK Rokit 6 G3's, and a Yamaha MM8 keyboard. My microphone is a Sterling Audio ST55 condenser, and I have a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50's. Super simplistic! Software-wise, I use FL Studio to compose mostly everything (besides vocals and guitar), and once everything is composed I split all the tracks out and bring them into Adobe Audition, which has been my DAW of choice for quite some time. It's definitely not the industry standard for music, but I just fly through the UI so much quicker with my familiarity of it and it has all the same features I need.</p><br /><br /><p>Instrumentation-wise, all the sounds you hear from bass to drums to synth, are going to be software VSTi's that I load up in FL Studio, and compose via MIDI with my keyboard (can you say crazy finger drumming skills?). Physical instruments include my acoustic and electric guitars, however the electric guitar is being routed through amp simulation software and not actually mic'd to an amp (which is nice because I have full control of the sounds and tone). I'm looking to add a physical bass to my arsenal at some point, but I don't have enough room for a drum kit at the moment.</p><br /><br /><p>I do indeed play all those instruments though. Piano is my main instrument and has been for 22 years. The classical influence is definitely from my days of private lessons through SDSU and UMKC. Beyond that, I was a percussionist throughout all of my school years, as well as in jazz band on keys. Funny story, was when during my senior year I wanted to be in the second level band because I had an open spot on my schedule. They were full of new students in the percussion section, and my director asked if I'd be interested in playing french horn instead. I had never played a wind/brass instrument up until that point, but I was up for the challenge. Long story short, I ended up going to state in a french horn trio!</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/zx0yc3NDM04?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=3764776895/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://bobbyyarsulik.bandcamp.com/track/ones-and-zeros"">Ones and Zeros by BSlick</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Talk about your two newest singles, “Ones and Zeros” and “PKGO The Server is Down.” What inspired them?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>""Ones and Zeros"" is a complete genre change and cover from an original song by Mineworks Animation on Youtube. They opened up a contest to do a cover and said you could do anything from sing over the original track (which was a very modern pop genre to start), or create your own. I ended up making this rock version instead and ended up winning their cover contest, which allowed me to have the right to sell it on iTunes and Spotify etc. I was super stoked to win and glad that they enjoyed it!</p><br /><br /><p>""PKGO The Server is Down"" is the epitome of how I love to have fun with what I do. As much as I like to keep it serious and create musical pieces that I'd love to see last with time, I love doing off-the-cuff and out-of-the-box projects. Back when the Pokemon GO app was getting super popular, they were having massive problems with their server and no one ever seemed to be able to login to the game, despite their want and craving. I took that opportunity to translate that scenario into a tongue-and-cheek, punk rock tune.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/VslMPy1uHZw?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you the most about the Kansas City music community?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I think I would say the most inspiring thing to me would be how connected the music community is with the nightlife and surrounding area entertainment. There are many opportunities for the musicians of KC to perform and share their creations with the citizens who love to listen to it. It's very easy for someone to get a hold of a venue, big or small, and find opportunities of getting their name and their music out there. If it wasn't for the people who crave this live music, then musicians here wouldn't have those opportunities to grow socially. I think it's also important to note that it's important for the music community to stick together. It's never about being competitive. We all influence each other, and we are all creating our own works of art. If we remember to reach out to each other and give each other opportunities for growth and networking, then the music community will surely flourish even more so than it already is.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/R3vGjaPJnoQ?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=1356142261/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://bobbyyarsulik.bandcamp.com/track/wither"">Wither by BSlick</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p>The funny thing about that, is that I was never passionate about reading until I was a senior in high school. My then girlfriend (now wife), introduced me to the author Ted Dekker. I read the book she let me borrow, <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/630639036_saint"">Saint</a></strong></em>, and was instantly hooked. I now have read many of his novels (both Christian fiction and thriller), and I absolutely love them. My recommendation from his library would definitely be his <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1090720036_the_circle_series"">Circle Series</a></strong></em>. It definitely pulls you in and the story keeps you gripping on to its pages throughout the story. Another influential book for me was <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/607136036_the_road"">The Road</a></strong></em> by Cormac McCarthy. This was another one of the early books I read, and I had gone to the store and forced myself to purchase it (because the premise sounded interesting to me, being about a post-apocalyptic world). The way McCarthy writes the conversations between the two main characters just made it seem very surreal, and turned events throughout the story into very emotionally gripping ones.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1478281609","1485194237","0","0","Singer - Songwriter|Uncategorizable|Pop|Eclectic","pop","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/bobby-yarsulik","",""

His music connects elements from acoustic folk and blues with spoken word poetry.  We are grateful to share an exclusive interview with and recommendations from the artist himself.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where are you from originally and where do you live and work currently? </strong>My name is Chico Sierra and I am originally from El Paso, TX. I live in Historic Northeast Kansas City. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>You’re a multidisciplinary artist in the truest sense: a photographer, sculptor, poet and musician. What do you see as the main connection(s) between your music and your visual art?  T</strong>here is a need to be genuine with my expression, no matter what the medium. I strive for accessibility. I want to be open, I don't want there to be any mystery about what I am trying to say. Whether I'm painting, singing, speaking or writing I want there to be an open connection between the audience and myself. </p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Describe a typical day. How you prioritize your work? </strong>I prioritize by emotion, depending on the feeling that is currently at the edge of my my mind will dictate the medium, whatever is drawing me in at the moment. It may not make the most sense as far as timing is concerned but it keeps my work honest. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What inspired the collection of songs you’ve shared on Soundcloud? </strong>My music has always been centered around themes of love, loss, and longing. It is by far my most cathartic form of expression and which is why I think it tends to be more emotional and raw. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What inspires you about music and art in Kansas City?</strong>  I love the overlapping artistic communities and the ability of artists to collaborate and learn from one another.

A duo since 2010, Jeff (""Victor"") Freling and Erin (""Penny"") McGrane tour relentlessly and are a highly regarded live act in Kansas City and abroad. If you're new to their music, you're in for a treat. Enjoy our interview and their book, music and movie recommendations.</p><br /><br /><p>* </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourselves. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>JEFF:</strong> We are Jeff Freling (a.k.a. Victor) and Erin McGrane (a.k.a. Penny).  We live in a house in the Westside neighborhood of downtown Kansas City, MO.  We love our diverse, eclectic community and we're close to Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts and everything going on downtown. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>ERIN:</strong>  When we're not touring (about 120 days this year); we work primarily from our home. Our kitchen serves as our office space and command central to handle the mountain of emails and paperwork that accompany self-employed national touring artists.  </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>JEFF:</strong> We have a music room upstairs that's the heart of our creative space.  In it, we have our instruments, simple recording equipment, and sheet music and charts.  We also have a little rehearsal space in our garage where we can meet with the band. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>ERIN:</strong>  We are currently carving out individual space for ourselves as well - a sewing and creative desk for me and a workbench for Jeff.  My favorite thing about our house is our front porch, where I like to sit, read, think, talk to neighbors and just be calm.  Our lives can be very rushed and hectic and having this home space helps us renew and recharge. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Your website describes your latest album <em>Electricity</em> as “the culmination of 160,000 miles, 5 years and nearly 1,000 performances.” What helps you stay creative while on the road?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>JEFF</strong>: Listening to other people's music while we're driving stimulates my brain, inspires me, and gets my ideas flowing.  Sometimes we voice record ideas like horn parts while we're driving (Erin runs the recorder - don't worry!).  One of the best things about touring is meeting other artists, hearing their music, and playing together with them - that's very inspiring to us.  </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>ERIN</strong>: We're developing a tight family of touring friends that we know and love.  For example, we met a new musician friend at a recent ukulele fest we attended and within hours we'd found our sweet spot, dusted off an old tune and ended up performing it all together at our showcase.  That kind of musical connection is magical. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>In terms of how and when we write while on the road, I used to play ukulele in the car all the time - that's really how I learned to play when I was just beginning.  We would also work out parts and rehearse harmonies using the ukulele in the car. Unfortunately, I developed tendonitis in my elbow from playing in the car, so I don't do that much anymore.  Now I work more on lyrics.   </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>JEFF:</strong> Occasionally we write or practice in hotel rooms, but we manage every aspect of our touring ourselves, and are often too tired after a long day of driving and playing a show. If we have a few days at a time in one place - we always take advantage of that to play and write.  Those days can be a real gift.  We're working on arranging our touring schedule to have more of those opportunities. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/JPXMSB3MSPg?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while recording <em>Electricity</em>? How did you overcome them?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>ERIN</strong>: Logistically ""Electricity"" was challenging because we took our full band to Nashville to record the album for 3 weeks.  That was difficult financially, and also hard to work with everyone's schedules.  Kyle Dahlquist ended up flying across the US, catching a brutal red-eye and got to the studio just in time to record, even though he hadn't slept.  Our band was committed and helped make this dream a reality by working with us to make it happen by being flexible and having great attitudes.  We appreciated their enthusiasm and once we got into the studio, they all brought their best performances. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>JEFF</strong>: ""Electricity"" was the first album on which we utilized a producer, an A&R person, and a radio promoter.  Navigating the complexities of giving other people creative input was new for us and definitely a challenge.  Each person (including us) had a slightly different agenda, or perhaps a different approach to achieving the same end goal. And keeping everyone engaged and satisfied was not easy.  Erin and I had many conversations about what we ultimately wanted to make sure we kept ourselves on track.  </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>ERIN</strong>: Even though we didn't always agree, the great part of working with talented, experienced Nashville people was hearing their ideas and using their knowledge to make the best-sounding album we've made so far.  Their confidence and enthusiasm for our music were inspiring and encouraged us to push ourselves.  But, pushing ourselves to our limits was also scary and brought out all those old self-doubts, resulting in late-night pep talks.  Anyone who has recorded a full-length album will tell you that making art takes blood, sweat, and tears.  </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>JEFF</strong>: ...and dollars. Raising the money for the record and managing those finances was stressful, but worth it. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/nfzGPuCiugQ?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What Kansas City artists are you currently raving about?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>ERIN:</strong> We have so many friends and collaborators in Kansas City that it's hard to pick. Our vibrant artistic community is one of the reasons we choose to live here, and the KC music scene is rich and thick with talent.  To name one to watch -- Calvin Arsenia is one of the great young voices of our city.  His passion and spirit are genuine and his voice gives me shivers!  I can't wait to hear what he does in the next few years.  Rock bands like the Philistines are making a name for themselves regionally, and new groups like Emmaline Twist are emerging on the scene with a bang. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>JEFF</strong>:  Mikal Shapiro and Chad Brothers are producing great work right now and Mikal's terrific songwriting and lyrics are blooming. The jazz scene is giving us talented instrumentalists like Ken Lovern, Peter Schlamb, Brian Baggett and Hermon Mehari who are energizing the musical community and raising the bar. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>ERIN</strong>: Because of my work with Artist INC, I have the opportunity to work closely with artists across all disciplines (visual, literary, photography, dance, film, sculpture, spoken word, etc.). Those conversations and the exposure to new art reshapes and expands the way I think about creativity and expression and moves me in new directions. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What makes Kansas City a great place for music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>JEFF:</strong> We're inspired by the diversity of our local music scene and the plentiful opportunities to work together.  For example, we love the work Beau Bledsoe and Ensemble Iberica are doing and we're thrilled to be able to collaborate with them. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>ERIN</strong>: We've seen the venue owners in KC commit themselves to growing the music scene. Frank Hicks from Knuckleheads is expanding his space to bring in national acts while also providing a stage for local and regional artists. We're thrilled that Steve Tulipana and Shawn Sherrill have reopened the Record Bar at a larger, better location in downtown KC. John Scott has made Green Lady Lounge an instant KC legend with excellent free live jazz seven nights a week at a place that's dripping with style, and Jody Hendricks has been tirelessly cultivating the roots music scene at the Westport Saloon.  </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>JEFF:</strong> Two new record labels have arisen out of local venues:  Little Class Records from Westport Saloon and Middle Class Records from the Record Bar.  We have just signed with Middle Class Records and look forward to making our next record here in Kansas City.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>ERIN:</strong> We're fortunate to live in Kansas City right now.  The zeitgeist that's happening here is exciting.  We need to travel and present our music in other markets, but we'll always want to make art and collaborate with our community right here in KC.  </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/QCyXoCx4yEY?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Erin and Jeff's book, movie and music recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Music:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><em>Four Boys And A Guitar</em> </strong>by <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Mills+Brothers%22&search_category=author&t=author"">The Mills Brothers</a>  </p><br /><br /><p><em><strong>The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society</strong></em> by <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Kinks+%28Musical+group%29%22&search_category=author&t=author"">The Kinks </a></p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1394787036_the_musical"">The Musical</a></em> </strong>by Mikal Shapiro </p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1447100036_birds_say"">Birds Say</a></em> </strong>by Darlingside </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Movies:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/340303036_annie_hall"">Annie Hall</a></em> (1977)</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/418117036_metropolis"">Metropolis</a></em> (1927)</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1193859036_moonrise_kingdom"">Moonrise Kingdom</a></em> (2012)</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/998118036_up_in_the_air"">Up In The Air</a></em> (2009)</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926)</strong></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/BW.jpg"" width=""1500"" height=""1500"" alt=""Victor and Penny"" title=""Victor and Penny"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div>    <p><strong>Books:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/93337036_siddhartha"">Siddhartha</a></em> </strong> by Hermann Hesse</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Off Beat: Collaborating with Kerouac </strong>by David Amram</p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1320119036_breakfast_of_champions"">Breakfast of Champions</a></em> </strong>by Kurt Vonnegut</p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/228592036_even_cowgirls_get_the_blues"">Even Cowgirls Get The Blues</a></em> </strong>by Tom Robbins</p><br /><br /><p><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/112312036_a_prayer_for_owen_meany""><strong>A Prayer For Owen Meany </strong></a></em>by John Irving</p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1480442631","1484927426","0","0","Eclectic|Folk - Americana","folk|swing","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/victor-and-penny","http://www.victorandpenny.com/","Learn more about Victor and Penny here."

We are fortunate to welcome MacKenzie Reed to Listen Local.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p>  </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Hi!  I am a classically trained multi-keyboardist, composer, writer, and dancer.  I live in Kansas City, MO but also travel frequently.  This year alone I have performed in Chicago, Reykjavik, and Tokyo.  </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>You’re involved with so many different aspects of composing that it’s hard to know where to begin. Let’s start with your recently-won Charlotte Street Foundation Studio Residency. What are your plans for this residency?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Shortly after I moved to Kansas City, I became a musician for Moondrop Circus, a local for-hire circus troupe.  I collaborate to create and perform music for their shows, but I am also interested in creating original projects that use circus arts and live music to tell a story.  I actually integrated this involvement with the circus community into my residency.  On the weekend of the Charlotte Street Performers’ showcase, some of my circus collaborators and I performed a show in downtown in the middle of the lunch hour.  It was so much fun to watch the reactions of passers-by!  I love injecting this kind of performance art into everyday life.  <strong> </strong></p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/240572702&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Your Tweet from November 6, 2015, describes very well your scope as an artist: “Today: playing organ for the Episcopal Diocese of West Missouri. Tomorrow: a belly dance solo for the Grassroots Juggling Festival.” Connect these two endeavors for us.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I do have a very interesting performing life!  I have worked as a church organist since I was a teenager; it has been my primary means of support.  On that particular weekend, I played organ for a Eucharist with 300 Episcopalians in a hotel ballroom.  Then I jetted up to Iowa to perform in a showcase during a juggling festival.  I love all aspects of performing, and I get different benefits from these varying outlets.  As a dancer, I can connect with my audience in a much more direct and energetic way.  As an instrumentalist, my focus and heart goes through the instrument which really serves as a conduit of expression between the audience and myself.    </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What tools do you use to compose? What may surprise a listener about how your music is created?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Most of the music I compose is very narrative-driven; I tend to start with a creative writing exercise that helps me determine a story, character, or mood.  I’m also very visually-oriented, so I’ll even put up photos in my studio that inspire the music I want to create.   </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Who really inspires you as an artist?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Interestingly enough, my biggest inspirations are comedians!  Bill Bailey and Tim Minchin really inspire me because they’re both such fantastic musicians who wrap their music into their comedy routines.  They’re incredibly versatile and have unique approaches to other performing arts - like acting - because, I believe, of their musical training.  </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/204144697&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe><iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/204004869&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you the most about the Kansas City music community?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>What is unique about Kansas City is how warm and supportive the entire arts community is.

While married couple Tammy and Stephen Herzig are the band's musical and songwriting core, the duo recently expanded to a four-piece upon the release of their excellent <em>Pink</em> EP. We are pleased to help spread the word about this Kansas City band with an interview with Tammy Herzig, along with the band's book, movie and music recommendations.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourselves. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Stephen and I have been playing together and been together for almost ten years. It's trite, but we we're friends first so making music together has always been really easy. Stephen graduated from UMKC and is an electrical engineer. He is the marketing director as well for the local firm Herzig Engineering. I am a stay at home mom/artist that home schools our children. There are 7 total but only 5 at home. I follow the unschooling method. This terrifies their grandparents but has made for some very self-sufficient and unusual children. It also allows us to be pretty tight here and still play music as a band.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/260191786&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Shed some light on the origins of Violent Bear.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>We started as the West for a couple years, but found that a band in Seattle already had that name and a pretty heavy following. So a couple years back after taking some time off to procreate again we decided to call ourselves Violent Bear. This was based off one of both of our favorite novels by Flannery O'Connor, the Violent Bear It Away. Our original sound was roots music and Southern Gothic so this suited us very well. Over the last couple of years we have been joined by the Cassity Brothers. Noah, intellectual bleeding heart that might be one of the most creative humans ever on lead guitar, and his older brother, bassist Jonas. Jonas has added a ton of depth and character to the sound. What was once a mom and pop garage folk band has kind of reinvented itself totally out of our control. Stephen is on percussion but every now and again he will sing live. I write most of our music and front (use that term loosely) the band. Recently Noah has started to write some of our music and it has become much more politically charged as well as gained a more youthful tone. We learned early on that we were making music out of love and because we felt like we had something to say and stories to tell. Turns out this has allowed us to be okay with the sound as it starts to take on a life of its own.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Talk about how you both make Violent Bear work as a creative union in the context of a marriage. How do you move through creative blocks and disagreements?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I should have had Stephen write this as he is actually a writer by trade as well. He tried his hand at novels but ended up writing engineer training manuals. Hahahahah. As far as working through the creative aspect of the project, I most often do the foundation writing and the lyrics. And because Stephen is so chill, he really doesn't get too controlling of that. Though one of our most popular songs, ""Ghost and the Canary"" was written after I heard him playing this haunting banjo riff. I had just finished reading <em>The Cove</em> by Ron Rash (great book) and that riff reminded me of the plot line. So ""Ghost and the Canary"" is actually about the novel. Our new stuff has totally come from a place in our past. I was in a punk band as a kid and wanted to kind of get that voice out there again, even if in a more mature manner. Having a couple college guys in the band hasn't hurt either, as youth makes you feel youthful! Contagious, ya know.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/case%20cover_0.jpg"" width=""959"" height=""960"" alt=""Violent Bear"" title=""Violent Bear"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/260191778&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How and where do you record your music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>We recorded our first album (using term loosely) in our friend Matt Allen's basement. Though in all fairness he is a sound engineer with top of the line education and equipment, so it was professionally done. After that we have just sort of messed around with home recording, though I think we will hit the studio this winter. We have a show this Friday then are taking some time off until February so it will be a great time to tackle a new project. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What inspires you about music and art in Kansas City? </strong></p><br /><br /><p>Kansas city is such a strange place for music and art as it is all over the place. Actually, most of our original sound came from our time in the south and living in Pensacola. It still has our heart. But I like the slow modernization of KC. Also there are some really amazing and progressive bands. Drugs & Attics and Shadow Rabbits are two of my faves for sure. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/violent_bear1_0.jpg"" width=""720"" height=""720"" alt=""Violent Bear"" title=""Violent Bear"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/193224822&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Book, movie and music recommendations from Violent Bear:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Stephen:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Book<em>:<strong> <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/902088036_infinite_jest"">Infinite Jest</a></strong></em> <strong>by Davis Foster Wallace</strong>.

PARTs I, II, and III are my first and only albums, so they progress thematically as well structurally. Similarly, The series itself is about change, good and bad, literal and figuratively. The Dead, The Wise, and The Illu respectively are about re-birth, new knowledge gained, and transitions made.

I believe it's role is to bridge ideas and build connections. Art, especially visual and video art, is used to guide people's opinion and emotion. Art and design is in everything we have, so with the digital inclusion, visuals are being seen and processed way faster. To be multi-disciplined to me in the information age, means more opportunities to connect with more ideas. In a time where media is instant, it's also a great time to try different things. Being multi-disciplined in any form of study is something I advocate for, and I believe will someday be the norm. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" id=""vimeo-154776678"" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/154776678?width=640&height=360&color=00adef&portrait=1&title=1&byline=1&autoplay=0&loop=0&player_id=vimeo-154776678"" frameborder=""0"" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Tell us about Strange Paper Studio.

I met my wife in 2007 and moved to south Kansas City in Raymore where I live today with my wife, son, and dog. I earn money working with a local beekeeper in Peculiar.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Talk about the set of songs you’ve shared called “The Basement Demos.” How long have they been kicking around? What’s the story behind this particular collection of songs?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Well the Basement Demos have been around for about two months. I have been writing songs for about two years but this summer was my first attempt at performing them in front of people. In order to demonstrate my sound for purposes of getting gigs I recorded these songs to give the listener a taste of the types of music I write/perform.  I referred to them as the Basement Demos because I recorded them in my basement.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""520"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://www.reverbnation.com/widget_code/html_widget/artist_5251869?widget_id=55&pwc[included_songs]=1&context_type=page_object"" style=""width:0px;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You describe your music as “old time balladeer + space blues + a pinch of punk grass.” What are the roots of this style for you? Who are your influences?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Well I would say my biggest influences are the thought provoking, poetic singer songwriters such as Bob Dylan, Townes Van Zandt, Gene Clark, David Bromberg, Tom Waits, Randy Newman, Neil Young, Gram Parsons, Lou Reed.  I am also completely obsessed with the prewar blues era from the 1920s, 30s, and 40s. Bluesman like Skip James, Blind Willie McTell, Gus Cannon, Bukka White, Charlie Patton, Lightnin' Hopkins, Reverend Gary Davis.  I also have immersed myself in bluegrass music the past couple of years.  I love Bill Monroe!! I work a lot on flatpick guitar. Guys like Doc Watson, Clarence White and Norman Blake.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/WtJ_7rpTJWg?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How do you record your music? What tools do you use?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The demos I recorded myself, which is probably really noticeable. I have no idea what I am doing when I record. Like I said I just wanted to get a couple of songs out to showcase my sound and direction. I thought about down the road investing in some quality sound equipment and get in to producing albums but as of right now I am researching professionals to help with the first album.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What inspires you about current Kansas City blues and folk music?  </strong></p><br /><br /><p>There is always someone to look up too. There is such a variety and depth of talent that it is almost unreal. I don’t make it into the city often but every time I do I meet someone that puts me back behind the pen and piano. The scene definitely motivates me to work harder. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/ynziJcwmZ_M?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Wade's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/730457036_on_the_road"">On the Road</a></strong></em> <strong>by Jack Kerouac.</strong>  This is the Bible for us that yearn for more than conformity and a bland general society.

This album was never meant to be an album, given that it is unrehearsed, unscripted, incomplete, and just plain perfect.  The themes make me laugh, cry and everything in between.  It is just a group of guys having fun in a basement playing music with no rules, expectations or any kind of outside devices.

Their combined powers are on full display in Emmaline Twist, a sonic amalgam of so many right elements: shoegaze, post-punk and atmospheric dance rock, for starters. While the band began only a year ago, 2016 saw the release of two songs, ""Vega"" and ""Moon Eyes"", that will make anyone eager for a full-length. We are thrilled to share an interview with Emmaline Twist's baritone guitarist, Krysztof Nemeth.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourselves. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Meredith McGrade - Vocals & Guitar - KCMO<br /><br /><br />	Kristin Thompson Conkright - Bass - KCMO<br /><br /><br />	Jonathan Knecht - Drums - KCMO<br /><br /><br />	Krysztof Nemeth - Baritone Guitar - KCMO</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Emmaline Twist was formed in 2016. What brought you all together?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>At the end of 2015, each of us found ourselves “between projects”, and having conversations amongst each other individually about what to do next. Krysztof and Meredith had been talking for years about their shared love for “Dark 80’s” bands like The Cure, Joy Division / New Order, etc, and “Shoegaze 90’s” bands like Slowdive, Jesus & Mary Chain, etc. The idea was born to try our hand at writing that kind of music, ourselves, because simply, it’s what we wanted to hear.</p><br /><br /><p>Jon was asked to come play drums, and Kristin soon after joined on bass. The vibe was immediately positive between all of us, finding a focus in our vision of what we wanted to become, and gelling perfectly as a unit. All four of us took this sound that heavily recalls the music of the fore mentioned eras and styles, but updates it with a contemporary rock groove that makes it sound very fresh and new.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/5Tcp2JjOF_E?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>In terms of songwriting, who brings what to the table? What drives the inspiration of the band?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The songs start out as demos that Krysztof works up, but then grow into the songs after each member of the band brings their voice, style, and taste to the mix. The joy for us is taking an idea and making it “ours”, and imbuing it with each of our styles and experience to make a song distinctly “Twisted”.</p><br /><br /><p>The inspiration for our music is driven by what we can do with that previously described sound. We know the palette we are working with, but we don’t want to specifically mimic any band from the past, so we find what we can do with all the influences we know fit into those categories, and make something new out of it.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/fWYm-jXx9kM?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Talk about your recently released single “Vega” / “Moon Eyes.” When can fans expect a full album?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>We are very proud of these songs. “Vega” is our “big radio statement” that announces our sound in a way that’s driving, and danceable. It’s also very moody, but upbeat at the same time. It truly encapsulates everything we want to present to our audience as a band, like a good single should. We just released a video for it, as well, directed by local film-maker and musician Steve Gardels.</p><br /><br /><p>“Moon Eyes” is our big, atmospheric, and anthemic set-closer. It shows the other side of the band; the enveloping, droning, and uplifting power of what we do as a musical force.</p><br /><br /><p>Both of these songs rely on instrumentation and lyrics that let the listener find what they need in their interpretation, never being about anything specifically. We like to let the listener decide.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/195023311&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you about music and art in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>This town is an awesome music town, both to be a musician and a listener in. It’s very welcoming, and not as competitive or as exclusive as a bigger city can be. There’s a tremendous diversity in style and presentation of the music being played. There's also great opportunity to collaborate, between bands, film makers, and more. There's a true spirit of collaboration and cross-pollenation that helps build a better scene for everyone.

Hill</a> is an emerging classical composer and male soprano currently studying composition at UMKC's Conservatory of Music and Dance. His work, which includes a symphony, string quartets, a one-act opera and works for tuba, piano and voice, has been performed locally and internationally, most recently at the Zodiac Academy and Festival in Valdeblore, France. We are thrilled to share an interview with Aaron, as well as his book, music and movie recommendations.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Aaron S. Hill and I am a composer and male soprano living and working in Kansas City, MO.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>How long have you been a composer? Who were your earliest influences?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I've been composing since I was in sixth grade, but only really started taking it seriously in 2012 when I finished my first round of music theory at St. Charles Community College. My early compositions were piano preludes, a few attempts at string quartets, and an orchestral tone poem I conducted my final year there. My earliest influences were Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Berlioz, and, honestly, my first orchestra director, Mary Sweetin. She really helped me understand basic orchestration and was an early composition mentor to me as well. In fact, I still think of her as really being the catalyst of launching me into my current degree field.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/296532380&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your experience as a composition student at UMKC’s Conservatory. What does it mean to study composition? How has your work grown since you started the program?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The UMKC Composition department, in my experience, has a very open, supportive environment and are especially encouraging and willing to really offer many opportunities to the undergraduates. When studying composition at UMKC, you get a very personalized experience where you are in control of what you want to write, when you want to write it. The composition faculty then gives you suggestions, points you in the direction of piece that could help inspire you, and act as a support to help you get to where you need/want to go. Their focus is to try and help you get to the point where you find your own voice, and they do this by exposing you to a variety of styles and tools then teach you how to utilize those tools. I feel like since I arrived here, my work has grown more complex, more personal, and more focused. I discovered that I love writing opera, and as a male soprano I want to do what I can to expand the countertenor/male soprano rep in modern opera. I have found opportunities to experiment with this through amazing collaborations with Lyric Opera of KC and other students at UMKC.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/158164183&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What tools do you use for composing? What may surprise a listener about how your music is created?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I primarily do my notation through Finale 2014.5, but when coming up with ideas I use a variety of different tools. Sometimes I use the piano, my cello, my violin, or for visualizing more complex textures, I simply sing it to myself. Lately, I've been thinking about returning to pencil and paper for a bigger piece I want to write, to see how tearing myself away from the computer will affect my writing. Something that might surprise the listener is that a lot of the time, when creating my music, I usually compose in a kind of ""loop-de-loop"" process. I start writing, I eventually stop, go back and edit, then continue composing, then repeat the process. Once it's done, then I then do a final sweep of editing after a few showings.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/225099174&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you the most about the Kansas City classical music community?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I think that what I like about the Kansas City classical music community is that it is so open to new ideas and novel ways of creating music. The new music scene is a lot stronger here than where I'm from. In fact, what I love most about this city is the general atmosphere here. The architecture and culture here really help me get in the mood to compose. and a trip to the plaza usually helps me when I'm in a slow spot</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Aaron's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>1. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/945576036_thus_spoke_zarathustra"">Thus Spoke Zarathustra</a></strong></em> by Nietzsche </p><br /><br /><p>2. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/938573036_the_greatest_show_on_earth"">The Greatest Show On Earth</a></strong></em> by Richard Dawkins</p><br /><br /><p>3. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/217805036_wicked"">Wicked</a></strong></em> by Gregory Maquire</p><br /><br /><p>4. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/754176036_frankenstein,_or,_the_modern_prometheus"">Frankenstein</a></strong></em> by Mary Shelley</p><br /><br /><p>5. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/142847036_das_rheingold"">Das Rheingold</a></strong></em> (Opera DVD) </p><br /><br /><p>6. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/188545036_the_rite_of_spring_fireworks_firebird_suite"">The Rite of Spring, Fireworks; The Firebird Suite</a></strong></em> by Stravinsky (CD)</p><br /><br /><p>7. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/142708036_black_angels"">Black Angels</a></strong></em> by Kronos Quartet, CD</p><br /><br /><p>8. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/385159036_the_ligeti_project"">The Ligeti Project</a></strong></em> (CD)</p><br /><br /><p>9. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/891112036_phantom_of_the_opera"">Phantom of the Opera</a></strong></em> (silent film, DVD)</p><br /><br /><p>10. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/489073036_dial_m_for_murderquot"">Dial M for Murder</a></strong></em> (DVD)</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/-kp8LRCLXcc?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>","0","437","1","1483630965","1485537391","0","0","Classical","classical","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/aaron-hill","http://www.aaronshillmusic.com/","Learn more about Aaron's music here."

Comprised of Noah Bartelt (vocals and guitar), Scott Combs (guitar), Nick Brown (bass), and Tarquin Eugene Kellough (drums), the band are hot off the release of their excellent debut album <em>Bad Seed</em>. We are thrilled to share an interview with Noah and Scott in which they address the making of <em>Bad Seed, </em>their songwriting process and their numerous charity efforts.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourselves. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Noah:</strong> I'm Noah Bartelt, lead singer and one of the guitar players of The UK's. I was born in Dallas, TX, but was raised in Kansas City. I am currently going to UMKC for a degree in Theatre Sound Design and I work part time as a barista at Parkville Coffee.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Scott:</strong> I'm Scott Combs, I'm the lead guitarist of The UK's. I live in Kansas City and I work for the Park Hill School District as a tutor at Park Hill High School. I currently go to Johnson County Community College and I am pursuing a degree in video game development.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about your debut album, Bad Seed. Where was it recorded? How long had it been in the works?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Noah:</strong> I hesitate to use the term 'concept album' because it has a weird connotation, I prefer to call our debut album, Bad Seed a 'story album'. We recorded the album in January of 2016 at Element Recording Studios with Joel Nanos. The album story line that helped us write nearly half the songs came to me in late September of 2015. The album tells a tale about a man who is addicted to drugs and falls in love with a woman for whom he tries to get clean for, but he fails at getting clean and ends up accidentally killing the woman he loves in a drug induced rage. The album ends with a person who had always loved the woman, killing the drug addict to avenge the death of his love. It's a dark story line but it brings up topics and struggles that are real and powerful.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Scott:</strong> The majority of the album was written in about 4 or 5 months, but we had a couple songs (namely Sir Fish, White Out, and Far From the Shore) that we had been playing for the better part of a year. Looking back on it, it doesn't feel like it has been that long. I remember writing them with Noah and it feels like it was just yesterday.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""166"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/260860594&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How do the songs get written and arranged in the band? Who brings what to the table?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Scott:</strong> The music is written by the band as a whole, we all try to sit down and jam something out together so we all feel like we have an equal say in the writing process as opposed to one person writing the whole thing.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Noah:</strong> Sometimes one of us will bring a riff or melody that we have been working on and present it to the band and if it sticks, we all try to add our own flavor to it and jam out the structure of the song as a group. But like Scott said, some of the songs we write come from us just jamming together with no preconceptions. As far as words go, I write a lot of the lyrics with help and edits from Scott. The songwriting process for us is very much a group effort and we love to have a piece of everyone shine through in each song.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>How did The UK’s get involved with Camp Quality, which serves children with cancer? What other charities have the band been involved with?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Noah:</strong> We got involved with Camp Quality a few years back through a friend, Mike Borgia, who booked our shows at Czar Bar. When we heard about a benefit show there for Camp Quality, we jumped in to be a part of it with help from Mike. We have also organized charity concerts with other local bands and musicians that helped raise money for the Red Cross after the earthquake in Joplin, MO in 2011 and after Superstorm Sandy hit the east coast in 2012. We love to do anything we can to help those in need, and we use our art as a vehicle for that.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/6-CHxi7YlUA?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you about the Kansas City music community?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Noah:</strong> The most inspiring thing about the Kansas City music community is how many genres of music are being performed and blended here. There are amazing bands playing everything from reggae and ska to garage rock and punk to jazz and blues. And seeing so many bands get big followings outside of the region like Beautiful Bodies and Radkey is hugely inspiring for me.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Scott:</strong> The thing that inspires me most about the KC music community is that there's so many people who will listen to anything we have to play, because the love of music is so strong in this city, and most everyone we've come across has been super supportive and awesome. It's really cool to see bands like Radkey who started so young get as far as they have, and I think it has a lot to do with the music community here in KC.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/21255005&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Music Recommendations (Noah's Picks):</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/254450036_tragic_kingdom"">Tragic Kingdom</a></strong></em> <strong>by No Doubt </strong></p><br /><br /><p>This album is amazing from front to back. Not only did it introduce me to the genre of ska but it was definitely the very first album I ever danced to when I was just a baby. It blends the genres of ska and pop rock effortlessly and it's just a fun album to listen to. I have a very big soft spot for this album in my heart. It reminds me a lot of my childhood and my first introductions to music by my mom and dad.</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1157957036_maladroit"">Maladroit</a> by Weezer </strong></p><br /><br /><p>One of my favorite albums of all time has got to be <em>Maladroit</em> by Weezer. It was one of the first albums I fell in love with and I've been a hardcore Weezer fan ever since. There's something so anti-mainstream about the album but they are so unapologetic about it. It's something about those heavy guitar riffs like the one in Burndt Jamb that draws me to this album. It's so awesome!</p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/380534036_white_blood_cells"">White Blood Cells</a></em></strong> <strong>by The White Stripes </strong></p><br /><br /><p>This is another one of my favorite albums. I found the White Stripes and Weezer around 5th or 6th grade and those are the two bands that drew me to performing music. <em>White Blood Cells</em> is what made the White Stripes the White Stripes. Not only does it have the staples like ""Hotel Yorba"" and ""Fell In Love With A Girl"", it has some lesser known rockers like ""The Union Forever"" that takes words from the movie <em>Citizen Kane</em> and transforms them into a song. I think a lot of people take for granted how clever and inventive of a songwriter Jack White is.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Movies:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The film  <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1011622036_under_great_white_northern_lights"">Under Great White Northern Lights</a></strong></em> is a documentary of sorts about the White Stripes' 2007 tour across Canada. It shows Jack and Meg playing in every venue from a theater to a town square to a bowling alley. There's something so punk and careless about it but at the same time it shows how much compassion and love you can find in people you make music with.</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/984910036_it_might_get_loud"">It Might Get Loud</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/407895036_woodstock"">Woodstock</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1306385036_inside_llewyn_davis"">Inside Llewyn Davis</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/924089036_bottle_rocket"">Bottle Rocket</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Books:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1413503036_hunger_makes_me_a_modern_girl"">Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl</a></strong></em> is a really interesting autobiography about musician and comedian Carrie Brownstein. It's an equally funny and heartwarming book and its honesty is refreshing. She's a great storyteller which makes her already unique life even more entertaining and inspirational.</p><br /><br /><p>One of my favorite music biographies is <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1163568036_jimi_hendrix"">Jimi Hendrix: A Brother's Story</a></strong></em>. It is written by Jimi's brother, Leon Hendrix, and it goes far more in depth into his early life and experiences than any other biography I've read about Jimi. He seriously carried around a broom for a year when he was a kid pretending to play it like a guitar because he couldn't afford a real one. He was dead set on playing guitar, regardless of if he had one or not, and that blows my mind! I never knew that fun little fact until I read this book, and trust me there are plenty more in there.</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/322153036_slaughterhouse-five""><em><strong>Slaughterhouse-Five</strong></em> </a><strong>by Kurt Vonnegut</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1496184036_the_neverending_story"">The Never Ending Story</a></strong></em> <strong>by Michael Ende</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>​</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Scott's Picks:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1417870036_dark_black_makeup"">Dark Black Makeup</a></strong></em> <strong>by Radkey</strong>  </p><br /><br /><p>Gary Clark Jr. - Blak and Blu</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1482224036_swiss_army_man"">Swiss Army Man</a></strong></em> (DVD)</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/uks2.jpg"" width=""960"" height=""720"" alt=""The UKs"" title=""The Uks"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/260860479&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1484162570","1484924827","0","0","Rock|Pop|Alternative","rock","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/uks","https://www.reverbnation.com/uncountablekings01","learn more about The UKs here"

His range of musical styles is staggering, covering everything from solo piano to choral, orchestral work and electroacoustic work. Currently the Composer-in-Residence for the William Baker Festival Singers, Davis's influences are all over the map, citing Stravinsky, Sweet Honey in the Rock and Iron Maiden as a few of his favorites. Davis was kind enough to share his thoughts on being a composer and performer in Kansas City and his eclectic list of book and music recommendations.</p><br /><br /><p>* </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Ed, and I'm a composer, bass-baritone, educator, and occasional conductor originally from Chicago. Well, <em>originally</em> originally from a village called Rodmell in East Sussex, England, but I moved to Chicago at age 10, and lived there until I moved to Kansas City a few months ago to begin my studies at UMKC. I'm a first year DMA student in composition here, studying composition with Chen Yi and voice with Vinson Cole, and working as a Composers In The Schools (CITS) teaching artist. I'm also composer-in-residence for the William Baker Festival Singers, a member of the Kansas City Symphony Chorus, and bass section leader for the choir of St. Andrew's Episcopal Church.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/282886637&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Who or what got you into composing? Who were your earliest influences?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Initially I didn't want a career in music; I attended Knox College for my undergrad to pursue a degree in creative writing. That all changed when I joined the Knox College Choir, and my first semester we performed Frank Martin's incredible ""Mass for Double Choir."" I became obsessed with choral music, especially that of the Twentieth Century, and after collecting many eclectic recordings over the next year or so, my own musical ideas gradually came to me. I wrote my first work in 2009, a setting of Emily Dickinson (my love for literature and poetry never went away) for a cappella chorus, and my choir director/mentor Laura Lane encouraged me to keep writing. As I recall, my earliest influences were Martin, Eric Whitacre, Rachmaninoff, and Benjamin Britten, who's still one of my all-time favorites.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/220923374&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You have such a depth of work drawing on a variety of styles and disciplines. How has your work changed or grown since you entered the UMKC composition program?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I've only been at UMKC since August, but already I feel that my teachers and colleagues here have helped me grow as an artist considerably. For example, I've been taking a class called ""Aesthetics and Analysis of Electroacoustic Music"" with Paul Rudy, which has not only expanded my knowledge of electronic music (I've only composed for electronic media once before), but I'm discovering new ways to listen critically to music across all genres/media. Studying composition with Chen Yi has been invaluable, and every week I feel more confident composing for non-choral ensembles.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/202078128&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Where do you go to write your music? What tools do you use?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I'll use pencil and paper to sketch out a piece's structure or make brief notes about what I want to convey, but other than that the entire composition process happens in my head, and I notate everything directly into the computer. I have perfect pitch, so I don't need to use a piano. As long as I have pencil/paper and my laptop, I can compose anywhere! I usually do it at my desk at home. I once composed about 80% of a choral piece during a single nine-hour bus trip.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/93053755&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you about the Kansas City classical music community?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The classical music community here was what moved me to apply for UMKC in the first place!

Every time I listen to <em>The Rite of Spring </em>I hear something new, while <em>The Firebird </em>is an underrated masterpiece. It's hard to believe that Stravinsky wrote both of these before he was thirty...</p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1001434036_12_concertos"">12 Concertos</a></em> by Einojuhani Rautavaara</strong>. Finnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara died this past July, and he remains one of my favorite and most inspirational composers. His work is not known well enough in America, in my opinion! All twelve works on this collection are brilliant; Canticus Arcticus is the most well-known, but everything else, especially the violin and third piano concerto, are severely underrated.</p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/402602036_breaths"">Breaths</a></em> by Sweet Honey in the Rock. </strong>I don't often listen to non-classical music, but this album should be heard and enjoyed by everyone, no matter your musical background/preferences. These women create an incredible sound together, and their songs are just as powerful and resonant today as when they were first written.</p><br /><br /><p><strong><em><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1410326036_the_book_of_souls"">The Book of Souls</a></em> by Iron Maiden. </strong>Another non-classical recommendation, but I can't help it; these guys are my all-time favorite band. Most of their best work was in the 80s (my #1 favorite is 1984's <em>Powerslave</em>), but every song on this album (from just last year!) is still pure, head-banging gold. Seeing them perform live is one of my bucket list items!</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div>","","437","1","1484777137","1485035371","0","0","Electronic|Classical","classical|choral","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/ed-frazier-davis","http://www.efdavis.com/","Learn more about Ed Frazier Davis's work here."

Led by sisters Teresa and Maria Elena Cuevas on vocals and bandleader and guitarist Garrett Nordstrom, Maria the Mexican carries the legacy of Teresa's and Maria's grandmother, Maria Teresa Alonzo Cuevas, the leader of the first all-female mariachi band in the 1970s. As her granddaughter states, ""she taught us how to perform professionally, stand up straight and sing out."" We are happy to share an interview with Maria Cuevas about her heritage, the band's creative process and her book and music recommendations.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourselves. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>	Maria The Mexican is organized around Maria Cuevas (myself) and Tess Cuevas (sisters). I am long time KC resident but have recently relocated to Lawrence.  Tess lives in Topeka. We both have day jobs right now.  I am a yoga instructor at Om Tree Shala in Lawrence and Tess is a stylist at Salon 808 in Topeka.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/ci_SWexXPOs?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Tell us about your latest album <em>South of the Border Moonlight</em>. Where was it recorded? What were some challenges you faced recording this album?</strong><br /><br /><br />	The record was initially tracked in Omaha at ARC studios by Ben Brodin.  Ben has engineered and played on albums by Pete Yorn, Bright Eyes, First Aid Kit, Big Harp. Most the rhythm tracks were cut there (bass, drums, rhythm guitars, most vocals). We used several studios to do overdubs like strings, horns guitars and organs (Weights and Measures, Electric Lovernland, Element, Awestruck——all in KC. But we did some at Lane Gibson studios in Burlington, VT. (The record was mixed there), Charles Eller Studios in San Pancho, Mexico, and Off the Wall Studios in Nashville (""One Eye"" and ""South of the Border Moonlight"" drums.)</p><br /><br /><p>	Garrett produced the record so the challenges are really his responsibility. He arranges it so we need only focus on our performances. Typically bands face the challenges of a high quality audio recording, getting a great drum sound, making sure all the instruments are in tune, the songs are at the right tempo, in the right key, have the right instrumentation, are mixed well...on and on and on.  The choices are limitless.   All those things are important of course but he has been able to allow our group to get some quality studio time without a bunch a challenges.  He helps make sure we have musicians we can count on ready to get busy. Also he helps to control the environment so the musicians feel like they have a place to express themselves within the context of our music.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/sCBvZ_S-EQ4?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What is the songwriting process like in Maria the Mexican? Over what period of time did the songs take shape for the new album?</strong><br /><br /><br />	The record was primarily written and arranged as a collaboration between Garrett Nordstrom (MTM's bandleader and rhythm guitarist) and I. Two of the songs were co-written by with friends of ours,  Jason Mayberry from Portland and Gary Lind from Omaha.  The process was a steady progression between Garrett and I in 2015.</p><br /><br /><p>	We would typically kick the songs around for awhile in rehearsals, make some kind of demo and then work more on the vocal melodies and lyrics. At some point early in that process we'd bring Tess in and begin writing the harmonies.  Also we come to some conclusion about which one of us is going to take the lead voice.  Sometimes Tess’ voice might be more suited for the tune but sometimes it is mine.  It is usually evident from the start.</p><br /><br /><p>	Then we’d introduce them to the band.  We were making changes to some of the arrangements during the sessions based on feedback from the players.  We have a very open collaboration process and some great musicians who always have something to add.  Sometimes it might be a chord change or a different feel.  Sometimes it’s a different beat or change to the melody line.</p><br /><br /><p>	Garrett had the song ""One Eye"" for awhile.  Jason Mayberry co wrote the lyrics.  We thought it fit in with our minor-melancholy motif so we worked on it for awhile and came up with an arrangement we like.</p><br /><br /><p>	It took several months to get ""The Citadel.""  I introduced Garrett to an traditional Mexican church song and he modulated the chords and melodies and came up with that one.  We had the first verse in 10 minutes but we kept refining the verse/chorus/bridge parts.</p><br /><br /><p>	""South of the Border Moonlight"" was a song Garrett wrote but we changed the key to fit our voices and completely re-wrote the lyrics together.</p><br /><br /><p>	The song ""Of Burning Flame"" was called ""Full of Flame"" but sometime after we thought the song was completely finished garret walked into the room exclaiming,”We have a new title for this song!”</p><br /><br /><p>	We were trying alternate lyrics, melodies and backup harmonies as we were recording them.</p><br /><br /><p>	 </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/_jdJAFU_gVU?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Both of you are granddaughters of Teresa Cuevas, who led the pioneering all-female mariachi band Teresa Cuevas. Talk about the cross-generational musical lineage connecting Teresa Cuevas and Maria the Mexican.</strong><br /><br /><br />	Our grandmother’s name was Maria Teresa.  I am Maria so it’s easy to assume the band is named after me but it is also named after her.  We chose the name so that we could confront the prejudice that comes with being called Mexican, or calling someone a Mexican.  Mexicans are not ashamed of being called Mexicans.  Our Mexican heritage has proud ancient roots with a history of incredible scientific, cultural, artistic and technological accomplishments.  Of course our musical lineage is part of that.</p><br /><br /><p>	We learned music from our grandmother.  She was the one that encouraged us to play music. Encouraged is a stretch because we were more honestly selected by her and our parents to be mariachi musicians.  The cross generational lineage is evident in the music that we play. Some of our songs our a type of roots rock but we are still performing traditional Mexican ballads, boleros, and huapangos.  We are tied to the Mexican community and traditions. She is the matriarch of our ethnicity.  We are Latinas.  Our grandmother helped to found one of the first all female mariachi groups in the country but she was also one of the first people to write that music down.  Before her day the music was just passed on…it wasn’t a genre where musicians read music from stands to perform.  It was done around a circle.  And…it was often passed down within a family so if your father, mother or grandmother played those songs it was likely you would learn how to play them.  We have all of her handwritten music on file and we have had to rent storage to keep it all.  We have 20 banker’s boxes full of mariachi music.</p><br /><br /><p>	Maria the Mexican carries the legacy of our grandmother’s music and our grandmother’s influence is with us everything we step on the stage or get in a recording booth. She taught us how to perform professionally, stand up straight and sing out.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/Ofu71JHKp-0?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What makes Kansas City a great place for music? Who are you currently raving about?</strong><br /><br /><br />	That’s an incredible question because what makes KC a great place for music for musicians and for the audience can sometimes be different</p><br /><br /><p>	For musicians:</p><br /><br /><p>	Knuckleheads makes KC a great place for music. Frank Hicks and his staff have developed a series of pro stages where musicians can showcase their talent to a diverse audience.  It is a venue where musicians can focus on their act and leave the promotion to the club.  The Knuckleheads staff really understands and accepts that it is really the promoter’s responsibility to promote so the musicians can relax a bit because they know that Frank is doing his job.  Some clubs leave the promotion to the bands.  It works out sometimes, sometimes not.</p><br /><br /><p>	We released our record at Knuckleheads.  To help promote that show we met Frank at the club and he drove us down to KCUR and introduced us to Chuck Haddix.  We spun some of our tracks on the ""Fish Fry"" and Frank drove us home.  How many other “bar owners” are arranging radio interviews and serving as a chauffeur and making introductions?  Speaking of the ""Fish Fry"",  Chuck Haddix makes KC a great place for music.</p><br /><br /><p>	Obviously there are other clubs that care about the local musicians.  The record bar have made a big contribution to the science for musicians.</p><br /><br /><p>	The jazz guys would be hurting if were not for Jon Scott and the Green Lady Lounge.  That guy has built something for the jazz community.  JPG Scott and Frank Hicks -- KC owes those guys.</p><br /><br /><p>	The staff at The Bridge 90.9 is a reason why KC is a great place for music.  They have dedicated themselves to putting local acts on the air, side by side with the national acts and the famous acts.  There is nothing more encouraging for bands than to have a 100,000 watt FM station willing to play your tunes.  That is a huge leap forward.  It’s feels great when the local recording sounds as good as something that is popping nationally.</p><br /><br /><p>We definitely need to include Rhonda Lyne and Sondra Freeman at the <a href=""http://midwestmusicfoundation.org"">Midwest Music Foundation</a>.</p><br /><br /><p>Right now the MMF gives health care grants to area musicians when they have health care emergencies and are underfunded.  If a musician breaks their arm and has trouble paying rent, MMF is there.  If their insurance fails to cover expense, MMF can grant up to 2K.  MMF is like Aflac for musicians.  KC has a strong organization looking out for them. Rhonda and Sondra are the backbone behind the organization.</p><br /><br /><p>MMF also puts on the midcoast takeover during SXSW.  MMF takes 60 band to Austin for the showcase.  Rhonda and Sondra are mostly responsible for giving KC area musician the opportunity to showcase their talent on a national stage. </p><br /><br /><p><br /><br />	For the fans (we are fans too):</p><br /><br /><p>	KC is a great place for music because there is a deep well of talent.  There are a bunch of great bands with diverse sounds. It is a tremendous asset for our community and it seems as if more and more people are making live music a cornerstone of their social lives.  To be a great place for music means there has to be large appreciative and engaged audiences.  It's great when any band can play in front of a large audience.  It’s even better when a large audience is a given because people just go out to see music…maybe it really didn’t matter who was playing because the place is going to be packed anyway?  In our opinion, the audiences are growing.</p><br /><br /><p>	We really like the new Heidi Gluck record.  The song “The Wolf” is very charged.  Ken Lovern’s Organ Jazz Trio is incredible. It’s instrumental, but wow.  They are the cornerstone of the Green Lady.  Chad Rex is about to drop a new record, the first one in 10 years and it’s going to be incredible. The Lawrence band SUNU is really groovy.  The stuff that Julia Haille and Tim Braun are doing with the BUHS is pretty great.  Hermon is in that band</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/KjwNpI1Q3u8?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Maria's Recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Books:</strong><br /><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/616493036_one_hundred_years_of_solitude"">100 Years of Solitude</a></strong></em> by Gabriel Garcia Marquez<br /><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/256505036_american_pastoral"">American Pastoral</a></strong></em> by Philip Roth<br /><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1327857036_autobiography_of_a_yogi"">Autobiography of a Yogi </a></strong></em>by Yogananda<br /><br /><br />	miles...the autobiography<br /><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/150822036_their_eyes_were_watching_god"">Their Eyes Were Watching God</a></strong></em> by Zora Heale Hurston</p><br /><br /><p>	<strong>Music:</strong><br /><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/281410036_rear_view_mirror"">Rear View Mirror</a></strong></em> by Townes van Zandt<br /><br /><br />	Anything by <a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=%22Sol%C3%ADs%2C+Javier%22&search_category=author&t=author"">Javier Solis</a> (mexican crooner)<br /><br /><br />	Solstis by Leon Lerregui solstis.

In the two years since her original feature, Kate has been an extremely busy artist and high school student. In addition to high-profile musical collaborations with Prozak, Tech N9ne and C the Gray, she also recently released her debut EP, <em>Bittersweet</em>. It's an all-too-short collection of songs that show remarkable growth and confidence. Enjoy our new interview with this Overland Park, Kansas-based artist and see what she's been reading and listening to lately.</p><br /><br /><p>* </p><br /><br /><p><strong>A lot has happened (and/or <em>you’ve made</em> a lot happen) since our first feature on you two years ago. You released your first EP, <em>Bittersweet</em>, in October, for starters. Talk about the recording of these songs. How did the EP come about? </strong></p><br /><br /><p><em>Bittersweet</em> came about because I felt I was ready to record something higher quality than what my home recording equipment could provide and I was trying to get a fuller sound. I wanted to do it this year because some college programs I was applying for asked for recordings and I felt having something I could sell at shows and a fuller sound would help me branch out and book more places.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/289770402&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You continue to collaborate in unexpected ways with other artists, most notably with Tech N9ne, Prozak and C the Gray. How does writing hooks for others compare with writing material for yourself?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Writing hooks for others is different because the process for it varies a lot. With C the Gray and ""House of Cards"" I was sent the track and I just had to write the vocal part and lyrics. With ""A Certain Comfort"" and ""Hold On Me"" I wrote the chord progression, vocal melody and lyrics. Writing hooks is sort of like writing a free response essay; it's like you're answering a prompt. Most of the time they'll tell me what the song is about or what sort of theme they want stressed in it. Whereas in my personal writing I usually either sit down to write with a specific idea in mind or I just play around until I come up with something I can work with. Also with writing hooks a lot of times you have to sort of generalize the lyrics so it can apply broadly to the subject, which is different from my personal writing where I can write specifically about personal experiences.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/289769545&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How do you look to for inspiration these days?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I just try to live my every day life to the fullest and experience everything possible to gain the most inspiration. also sometimes I'll look at a song title and try to write a song of my own around that title. I pay attention to words and try to catch very connotative phrases that I could use multiple ways. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/AgPMzgEsMx4?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Kate's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Books:</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1325814036_lets_get_lost"">Lets Get Lost</a></strong></em> by Adi Alsaid</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/994300036_will_grayson,_will_grayson"">Will Grayson, Will Grayson</a></strong></em> by John Green and David Levithan</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/612082036_its_kind_of_a_funny_story"">It's Kind of a Funny Story</a></strong></em> by Ned Vizzini</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/169218036_oliver_twist"">Oliver Twist</a></strong></em> by Charles Dickens</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/3678036_collected_works_of_edgar_allan_poe"">The Collected Works of Edgar Allen Poe</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Music:</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/189514036_rumours"">Rumors</a></strong></em> by Fleetwood Mac</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1139890036_the_dark_side_of_the_moon"">Dark Side of the Moon</a></strong></em> by Pink Floyd</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/911926036_the_open_door_ep"">The Open Door EP</a> </strong>by<strong> </strong></em>Death Cab for Cutie</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong>The Sun Will Rise</strong></em> by Priscilla Ahn</p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/kate_rose3.jpg"" width=""890"" height=""712"" alt=""Kate Rose"" title=""Kate Rose"" />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-caption-caption--field-image-with-caption.tpl.php -->    Kate Rose.

Over the past few years, Y the Ghost has craftily released a small handful of music and videos, with each new release reflecting an increased level of creativity and confidence. The latest chapter in an ongoing ""dramatic / romanticized / idealized snapshot"" of his life is the new synthpop single ""Dark."" It's a pleasure to catch up with Elliott to discuss his latest work and what's ahead for Y the Ghost in 2017.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong><br /><br /><br />	I currently live in the heart of Kansas City. I kind of live a Hannah Montana lifestyle except I only talk about the pop star part ;)</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Tell us about your new single ""Dark."" How does it connect with and build on the two previous chapters?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Each chapter is a dramatic / romanticized / idealized snapshot of my life in that current moment. My first single ""Is Anybody Out There"" was essentially a bottle in the ocean (aka the internet) and ""Can U Hear Me?"" was the message on the note inside. I think the bottle is still floating around in cyber space somewhere and will hopefully be found washed up on a beach someday. In the meantime, ""Dark"" marks the beginning of my actual descent into the physical world / the unknown. I've never taken this project out into the real world before but something about consciousness in 2016 has really shifted my priorities and my mindset. Something is giving me a sense of urgency to connect with people face to face .. but it's not necessarily a dooming feeling. It's wildly positive. Just urgent. I can't quite explain it currently but I'm gonna start following that instinct and living it.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/298149980&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Where was ""Dark"" recorded? Did you try anything differently this time?</strong><br /><br /><br />	I don't like to reveal too much about the recording process for the same reasons a magician would protect their illusion, but I will say that this is the very first time I have attempted production all on my own. Previously I would take several of my own drafts to different studios to tweak and master, but I've had some time to work on my own skills as a producer rather than being primarily a performer and songwriter. I'm much more self-sufficient now. The strings used in the instrumental (cello played by Cale Cindric) were recorded a few years ago when I was just starting to write my own music. I was much more lost then, but this year I finally felt equipped enough to complete a track that would do those dusty old string tracks justice. That sense of urgency I spoke of before has given me a newfound power and confidence that I've never truly had until now.</p><br /><br /></div><div ></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/T5Jbqj-YD1w?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What were your biggest musical discoveries in 2016?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Honestly my biggest discoveries this year were locals. I was pleasantly surprised to find more Kansas City musicians currently making what could (hopefully not in reductive terms) be considered ""pop"". I'm currently really impressed with Scammers, Casey Guest, Black Creatures, Coastless, and Ashley Ultra. (The last 3 are playing my debut house show on the 12/30!) On a wider scale, I felt really refreshed and healed by the return to earth/American humanity in Lady Gaga's ""Joanne"". Our culture really needed that this year and I hope no one misses out on it because of whatever image they may have in their mind of what they think Gaga is supposed to be. (Yes, I am one of those people)</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>What can fans expect in terms of more music and performances from you in 2017?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I think things are aligning exactly how they're supposed to in the time frame that is best for me in relationship to my environment. I'm gonna start using my shows to test out a lot tracks and tricks I've had up my sleeve for a while now. I think it's safe to say you can expect larger chunks of music being released simultaneously in 2017, some wild performances, and hopefully more videos! </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/hDRPUajgvbs?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Jacoby Elliott's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1451317036_junk"">Junk</a></strong></em> by M83 </p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1482188036_stranger_things"">Stranger Things: V1</a></strong></em> (OST)</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1200065036_sound_of_my_voice"">Sound Of My Voice</a></strong></em> (DVD)</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1482228036_american_horror_story,_the_complete_fifth_season"">American Horror Story: Hotel</a> </strong></em>(DVD)</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1484596036_bates_motel,_season_four"">Bates Motel: S4</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1120410036_screws_get_loose"">Screws Get Loose</a></strong></em> by Those Darlins </p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1092847036_wounded_rhymes"">Wounded Rhymes</a></strong></em> by Lykke Li </p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1322214036_i_never_learn"">I Never Learn</a></strong></em> by Lykke Li</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1488051036_joanne"">Joanne</a></strong></em> by Lady Gaga </p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1445396036_this_is_what_the_truth_feels_like"">This Is What The Truth Feels Like</a></strong></em> by Gwen Stefani </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/darkcover5.jpg"" width=""720"" height=""720"" alt=""Y the Ghost"" title=""Y the Ghost"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div></div>","0","437","1","1486672435","1486673284","0","0","Alternative|Electronic|Pop","pop","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/y-ghost-0","https://ytheghost.com/","Learn more about Y the Ghost here."

Originally from Inner Mongolia and currently making her home in Kansas City, Liu's music is a fusion of Chinese and the West, of folk tradition and abstract experimentation. The result is a deeply beautiful and adventurous listening experience. In this interview, Anqi describes her creative process, how her parents encouraged her, and how her studies at UMKC have helped shape her work.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I am Anqi Liu, a native Chinese composer. I was born in Inner Mongolia, the autonomous region in the north of China, populated by ethnic minorities. After I finished my master degree at Rutgers University, I held and performed some projects with my friends in NYC as a freelance musician. I am now working with Dr. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Long"">Zhou Long</a>, Dr. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Yi_(composer)"">Chen Yi</a> at UMKC Conservatory as a doctor candidate. At UMKC, I am also working with Dr. <a href=""http://conservatory.umkc.edu/faculty.cfm?r=1A25"">Paul Rudy</a> on electroacoustic music. I began piano training at age four but arrived late to composition, mostly teaching myself to compose at age eighteen, with an even later start in formal compositional studies at the age of twenty- three. I got bachelor's degree of law and music performance at Xiamen University. Without formal compositional training, my music degree included extensive travels throughout the Chinese hinterlands to study the folk music of Chinese minority groups. During my time in Rutgers University, close to Manhattan, I focused on avant-garde acoustic experiments and the fusing Chinese and Western classical musical sensibilities into a personal compositional style. As the first composer from the area to pursue a graduate degree in the U.S., I am committed to serving as an ambassador for my culture, and for empowering minorities through my work. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/295832400&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your music for new listeners</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My compositions come from a wide variety range of inspirations through my everyday life and my dreams. Instead of thinking too much on compositional techniques and forms, I believe the real creations must come from the innermost impulse of the creator. My hometown is famous for its beautiful folk music and its unique singing type. At the beginning, I didn’t realize this birthmark in my music, however, through time goes by, I start to see those ancient voice lines from my birthplace were embedded pervasively and silently in my piece. With a colorful texture, it’s like a rivulet, flowing eternally naturally. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/288070901&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How long have you been a composer? Who were your earliest influences?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I taught myself composing when I was eighteen but I see myself as a real composer since I came to the U.S. at 2013. The earliest influence is my parents. It was really tough if someone wants to be a creative artist in my hometown. A barrier to learning was the lack of educational resources in my hometown, which was isolated from modern civilization even though it has developed much better in recent years. People even have no idea about what is a composer and it was actually the same with my parents. But after I explained what I was going to do, they said: go for what you really want to be. They are the wisest parents in the world. If without them, I couldn’t start composing at all. It’s just no way</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/306905856&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What brought you to study composition at UMKC’s Conservatory? How has your work grown since you started the program?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I went a concert of Dr. Zhou Long and Dr. Chen Yi on Nov. 21st, 2014, at Carnegie. So specific, yes….I wrote the diary at the day: ""I want to be their student one day."" That was an unforgettable night that I was so impressed and inspired by their music. Since I came to UMKC Conservatory, Dr. Chen Yi has helped me to evoke my consciousness of timbrel structure in orchestral pieces and encouraged me on exploring my inner voice deeply. With my electronic music teacher, Dr. Paul Rudy, I started to explore the nuances and subtleties in the world of sound. I learned and grew a lot when I came to here. All significantly contribute to my life as a composer that I appreciate a lot.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>What inspires you the most about the Kansas City classical music community?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Classical musicians here are so supportive to new music with all the passions.

Their first EP, 2016' s <em>Mouth to Mouth </em>establishes their sound as a hybrid of musical, cinematic and literary influences, from Phillip K. Dick to H.P. Lovecraft to <em>2001: A Space </em><em>Odyssey. </em>We're fortunate to share an interview with this new Kansas City du about their work, influences and recording process. Enjoy!</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourselves. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>/encode:</strong>  My name is Xavier. As a musician I use the moniker “/encode.” Currently, besides doing music, I work at H&M in Kansas City, Missouri. It’s an international clothing store that started in Sweden and I really like working there.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Jade:</strong> I’m Jade. I live East of Troost, and I work in preschools. Community and education are the most important things to me. While I get paid for my work in schools, I do a lot of unpaid work organizing with Squad of Siblings, a local group that fights against sexual and gender based violence in and around Westport, KC. My dream is to open up my own school focused on problem-solving and multiple intelligence approaches, for kids from pre-k to 12th grade. I’m really interested in the framework of University Academy here in town.</p><br /><br /><p><br /><br />	 </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3795357427/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=265986811/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://theblackcreatures.bandcamp.com/album/mouth-2-mouth"">Mouth 2 Mouth by The Black Creatures</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Tell us about the origins of The Black Creatures.</strong><br /><strong>Jade:</strong> If I told you that, I’d have to kill you. JK. The Black Creatures started out as /encode and wiebke, our standalone personal projects. Oddly, we worked really well together from the get-go and decided, “Hey, why not put another song together….. and another…. and another…” Finally it became pretty clear we had our own energy as a unit, and the only real way to pay it respect was to give it a name. We are The Black Creatures.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3795357427/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2221870283/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://theblackcreatures.bandcamp.com/album/mouth-2-mouth"">Mouth 2 Mouth by The Black Creatures</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>I’m really curious about the science fiction influence on your work. Are there particular sci fi authors or films you point to as most influential?</strong><br /><strong>/encode:</strong> I love sci-fi films and novels so much their influence kind of permeates much of my life. I really love the dark, explorative tone of the Ridley Scott films <em>Alien</em> and <em>Prometheus</em>. The creatures in those films really make you feel small when thinking about the vastness of the universe and what’s out there. <em>Homestuck</em> by Andrew Hussie is a multimedia series that also influences the theme and tone of The Black Creatures. It’s one of those things that you really have to be invested in to see beyond its surface level dorkiness. As far as book-books go: Scott Westerfeld, James Patterson, and Charlie Jane Anders, to name a few, are authors who’ve had an impact on The Black Creatures’ narrative and direction.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Jade:</strong>  Dang… Well, I’m really into H. P. Lovecraft, Naoko Takeuchi’s <em>Sailor Moon</em>, and The Holders Series, the latter of which is a huge compilation of short stories submitted mostly anonymously that started out as a single creepypasta on the internet. <em>The Twilight Zone, 2001: A Space Odyssey</em> (the Stanley Kubrick film), anything by Hayao Miyazaki, and Paprika are a few visual works I’m pretty into.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3795357427/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=f171a2/tracklist=false/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://theblackcreatures.bandcamp.com/album/mouth-2-mouth"">Mouth 2 Mouth by The Black Creatures</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What was it like recording your first EP, <em>Mouth 2 Mouth</em>? What equipment and technology did you use? What did you learn from this process you’ll take to future projects?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Jade:</strong> It took a really long time from beginning to end. /encode moved across the country and back, I switched majors at school and changed jobs, Struggling with ongoing depression sometimes made weekly meetings difficult. We used a Blue Yeti mic, two MacBooks with Audacity and FL9 installed, and went through several $9 headphones. The biggest thing I learned was how important honesty and communication are when you’re working together. /encode has become one of my closest friends, as a benefit of working so well together and proving to be there for each other even when we aren’t at the top of our game.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3795357427/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=4241476223/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://theblackcreatures.bandcamp.com/album/mouth-2-mouth"">Mouth 2 Mouth by The Black Creatures</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you most about music in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>/encode:</strong> I’m coming to find myself intensely inspired by the local artists I’m beginning to know from this project with Jade. Even the people I’ve met most recently have inspired collaborative projects for the future. Their influence, freshly new or otherwise, has given me a new outlook and I hope to be a major influence to other artists as well. Hell, I hope to be an influence to anyone. Growing up here, I know what that can mean for someone. <br /><br /><br />	 </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Kansas City is the city of jazz, although we lost our one and only jazz station to a country station back in the early 2000s. All shade. Kansas City is one of the most hypersegregated cities in the United States. There’s so much unrest here. The same city bred Janelle Monae, a huge idol of mine, as well as Tech N9ne, both who use their music to speak out against racism. In the last couple years Monae’s seen success even on the silver screen. As a pessimistic adolescent, I didn’t think much could come out of this city; now as an adult who is no longer afraid of books and politics, I realize so much has come right from this soil. I hope I can honor my city with the work I do. Cuz I do it for all of us.<br /><br /><br />	 </p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>The Black Creatures' Book, Film and Music Recommendations:</strong><br /><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1432986036_all_the_birds_in_the_sky"">All The Birds In The Sky</a></strong></em> (Book) by Charlie Jane Anders<br /><br /><br />	Warrior and Witch (Book) by Marie Brennan<br /><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?q=Blood%2B+%28Television+program%29&search_category=title&t=title"">Blood+</a></strong></em> (Anime)<br /><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1096588036_flcl,_the_complete_series"">FLCL</a></strong></em> (Anime)<br /><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/657355036_a_scanner_darkly"">A Scanner Darkly</a></strong></em> (Book AND Film) by Philip K.

Her sound collages are worlds unto themselves, full of electric animals, alien strings and haunting echoes. A native of Turkey, Yesil has been deeply committed to helping develop the Kansas City electronic music community for more than a decade. We are excited to share this revealing interview with Nihan Yesil.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I am primarily a composer and a sound designer. I also work with projectors and create multi-media art.</p><br /><br /><p>I work in both acoustic and electronic media. I come from classical music background. In the last four years my work revolved around sound installations, electroacoustic music, and sound design for theatrical productions and screen.  I have lived in Kansas City since 2005, in the past few months I have been in between Kansas City and Los Angeles.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Describe your music and multi-disciplinary work for new listeners. What drives you to create?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My music would be best categorized within the genres of classical music. Majority of my work consists of chamber music and electroacoustic compositions. I love the intimacy of chamber music setting and with solo works I like to exhaust what expression is available within an instrument while staying within the ideas I choose for a composition. In both genres, I am almost obsessed with the concept of perception: how ideas, concepts, and sound are perceived by the listener and whether I can manipulate that. I work with spoken word and language often, especially in electronic medium. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" id=""vimeo-31515654"" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/31515654?width=640&height=360&color=00adef&portrait=1&title=1&byline=1&autoplay=0&loop=0&player_id=vimeo-31515654"" frameborder=""0"" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You’re originally from Turkey. What originally brought you to Kansas City? How has living here influenced your work over the years?</strong><br /><br /><br />	I came to Kansas City for my graduate studies in composition at the UMKC Conservatory. It’s not that common to find some of your favorite composers teaching at the same institution.  It was a truly rewarding experience. I started writing electroacoustic music there, which really changed the course of my career. I stayed after the program and continued to work here.  What I love the most about Kansas City is how invested and entrenched in the arts it is.  It is a very compact city and there’s a passionate art and music community.  You can be inspired by others’ work and collaborate with many wonderful artists, and it all happens within a comparatively small area.  There’s a dynamic electronic music community, which is continually fed by UMKC composers the conservatory nurtures. I am one of the founding members of Kansas City Electronic Music Alliance, the following generation of composers took over and it’s still an active group.  Then with a colleague of mine, we found SoundTheater, a collaborative endeavor that aims to bring electronic music and performing arts together in a way that will challenge audience’s perceptions of both disciplines. This was made possible through the inspiration we got from KC performing arts community and KC Fringe festival.  Support from organizations such as ArtsKC and Charlotte Street Foundation helped me establish my multi-media art. Kansas City provided me with the inspiration and support every step of the way as I defined and then redefined my work through the years.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" id=""vimeo-145298320"" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/145298320?width=640&height=360&color=00adef&portrait=1&title=1&byline=1&autoplay=0&loop=0&player_id=vimeo-145298320"" frameborder=""0"" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What projects are you currently working on?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I am currently designing sound for a feature film by Mountain Air Productions, LLC in Kansas City off location.

There’s a sense of responsibility within these groups, they want to inspire, educate, and create awareness within the community. There are handful of established groups and programs that didn’t exist when I arrived at Kansas City, and were founded by people who wanted to make an impact.  These activities challenge the music as well, because you cannot, or should not, repeat yourself but should reach for the next opening in your creation.  Then you start inspiring and influencing others, which generates a wonderfully artistic circulation. I have always been proud to be part of such activity and passion. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/NYesil_PressShot.jpg"" width=""4742"" height=""6813"" alt=""Nihan Yesil"" title=""Nihan Yesil"" />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-caption-caption--field-image-with-caption.tpl.php -->    Nihan Yesil        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div>    <p><strong>Nihan Yesil's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Books:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/348989036_emcp2_%28b"" target=""_blank"">""E=mc2:</a><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/348989036_emcp2_%28b"" target=""_blank""> A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation""</a></strong></em> by David Bodanis</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1071408036_how_i_killed_pluto_and_why_it_had_it_coming"" target=""_blank"">""How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming""</a></strong></em> by Mike Brown</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1418910036_the_relic_master"" target=""_blank"">""Relic Master""</a></strong></em> by Christopher Buckley</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/271390036_the_wind-up_bird_chronicle"" target=""_blank"">""The Wind-up Bird Chronicle""</a></strong></em> by Haruki Murakami</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Movies:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1390590036_pk?active_tab=summarized_details"" target=""_blank"">PK</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/481422036_touching_the_void"" target=""_blank"">Touching the Void</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1378513036_birdman"" target=""_blank"">Birdman</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Music:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1129975036_book_of_longing"" target=""_blank"">Book of Longing</a></strong></em> by Philip Glass</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/262773036_string_quartets_and_duets"" target=""_blank"">String Quartets and Duets</a></strong></em> by Gyorgy Ligeti</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/308774036_jen%C5%AFfa?active_tab=bib_info"" target=""_blank"">Jenufa</a></strong></em> by Leos Janacek</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/402351036_the_seasons?active_tab=bib_info"" target=""_blank"">The Seasons</a></strong></em> by John Cage</p><br /><br /><p>	 </p><br /><br /></div>","0","437","1","1488479567","1488479923","0","0","Classical|Electronic|Experimental","classical|experimental","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/nihan-yesil","http://nihanyesil.com/","Learn more about Nihan Yesil's music and video projects here."

We are a three piece band that writes folk influenced music with an electronic element.  Laurel and Ben write an equal amount of songs.  Laurel does a lot of string looping and layering in addition to vocals.  Ben sings, plays bass, guitar, bowed guitar, and the Abelton Push.  John Bersuch is the newest addition to the band.  He adds drum parts and sub bass when we've completed songs.  All three of us live in Kansas City and have known each other for ten years.  We've played together in other projects but now that we are older and wiser we have become very serious and focused with this particular project.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Tell us about the origins of Of Tree. How would you describe your music for new listeners?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Of Tree was formed when myself (Laurel) and Benjamin decided to collaborate on each others' music.  As a married couple we had to really work on how to separate out our personal relationship from what we were trying to create.  It took a while to learn how to work together in a sensitive musical way, but now we are each others favorite musicians to play with.  Our music is moody, orchestral, full of beautiful strings, dynamic and somewhat mournful.  However, we do try to create pop hooks in each of our songs.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/302648297&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You’re currently recording a new album. What has this process been like? What have you been learning about how best to record your music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>We just finished an EP of older songs from previous musical incarnations, but now we are getting ready to record our new stuff in April.  We are currently deciding which studio and engineer to work with and whether or not we want to record in Kansas City or get out of town and get everything tracked in a short amount of time.  As a string player I have to take into account the physical demands of my instrument so I am thinking its going to be a slower process than I want.  </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/302653537&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your songwriting process in terms of collaboration, creative stumbling blocks and inspiration.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Ben and I usually write song ideas separately and then flesh them out together.  Ben is a painter and a member of rock duo The Slights and I am a full time musician both classically and with my other group The Wires.  We try to prioritize Of Tree.  So far things have gone very smoothly.  The addition of John Bersuch has been a wonderful way to tie a bow on our music.  Of course, we wish we could do this project full time and perhaps we will someday.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/gIW2HAXsH0o?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What most inspires you about music in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>There are a lot of great musicians that live here!  Lots of styles.  I (Laurel) am very drawn to folk music and the fiddle community.  I am so inspired by the Folk Alliance.  I went last year and was literally in tears during the camp portion of the festival because I had been so blocked musically until I attended the workshops last year.  Since then stopped trying to get better at my classical technique which has been very frustrating and I am now focused on learning as many traditional tunes and alternative techniques as possible to put into my own music.</p><br /><br /><p>Ben just loves music in general.  He would go to a show every night if his schedule would allow it.  He loves all types of music, but especially Americana/folk.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/kLqLa8HhCCY?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Laurel Park's recommendations from the Johnson County Library:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1344804036_waking_up"">Waking Up</a></strong></em> by Sam Harris</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/205286036_saving_grace"">Saving Grace</a></strong></em> by Lee Smith</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/255748036_into_thin_air"">Into Thin Air</a></strong></em> by Jon Krakuer</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1149017036_the_snow_child"">The Snow Child</a></strong></em> by Eowyn Ivey</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/241567036_angelas_ashes"">Angela's Ashes</a></strong></em> by Frank McCourt</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/271390036_the_wind-up_bird_chronicle"">The Windup Bird Chronicle </a></strong></em>by Haruki Murakami</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1290091036_the_winter_people"">The Winter People</a></strong></em> by Jennifer McMahon</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/377734036_the_power_of_now"">The Power of Now </a></strong></em>by Eckhart Tolle</p><br /><br /><p>Movies:</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/349645036_the_shining_dvd"">The Shining</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /></div>","0","437","1","1488994764","1488994764","0","0","Folk - Americana|Indie","folk","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/trees","",""

While she only recently released her first collection of songs, Marcus has been writing music since the age of four. Marcus, who is also a photographer and mother of three children, uses music as a means to tell her own stories, and the songs on <em>Brave</em> are rich with their own snapshots of life and hard lessons. We are excited to share an interview with Amy Marcus about her new music and creative process, along with her book recommendations.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself.  Describe your music for new listeners.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Amy Marcus.  I would describe my music as real, honest lyrics set to folk/roots inspired melodies.  </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>How long have you been a songwriter? How long have the songs on <em>Brave</em> been around?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I've been writing songs for as long as I can remember.  I would go sit at our piano starting at about the age of 3 or 4 and figure out melodies and put words to them.  My parents use to make my brother and sister sit and listen so that I could pretend like I was having a concert.  </p><br /><br /><p>Three of the songs on <em>Brave</em> I wrote the year before we released it.  The other two I had written a few years back.  Music is therapy for me, so the lyrics all revolve around things I was working through when I wrote them.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/p4LxYIDG7is?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Talk about the recording of <em>Brave. </em> Who did you record it with? Were there any challenges in getting the sound you wanted?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Recording <em>Brave</em> kind of came out of nowhere for me.  I had always wanted to put out an album but never really had the right opportunity.  I recorded the EP with Rob Guy of Serve Productions.  Rob had come across some of my music on Youtube and reached out to see if I'd be interested in putting an EP together.  He was trying to make the transition from live sound production to more freelance studio projects and this was my first recording of my own. (I had done back ground vocals here and there for some people.).  It was definitely a learning curve for both of us I think.  I went from writing these songs alone in my living room, to teaching them to studio musicians and learning the recording process.  It took some  back and forth to get the sound where we both wanted it, but Rob did an amazing job with it. </p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>How do you move through creative blocks? Who or what inspires you?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Creative blocks are the worst.  I have several outlets for creativity and if I'm not feeling like songs are coming easily, I move on to another outlet for a while.  I really try not to force out songs.  I write what I'm feeling and typically they flow pretty naturally.  My kids inspire me.  I have 3 kids ages 9, 6 and 3 and they keep me going.  I want them to teach them to pursue your dreams in life, and I think leading by example is one of the best ways to do that.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/259767780&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you the most about music in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Kansas City has such an amazing collection of talented musicians.

It's taught me that even with so many incredible musicians in the area, none of us are the same, we all bring something to the table, and supporting each other through this journey is important. It's been refreshing.  </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/263329137&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Amy's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1295054036_the_weight_of_blood"">The Weight Of Blood</a> </strong></em>by Laura McHugh.<em><strong> </strong></em>A really well written mystery </p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/173506036_baby"">Baby</a> </strong></em>by Patricia MacLachlan.<em><strong> </strong></em>A junior fiction, but an all time favorite</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1396628036_kitchens_of_the_great_midwest"">Kitchens of the Great Midwest</a></strong></em> by J.

Professor"" Mason. KCUR called their first single, ""Fall in Love,"" ""a strong contender for best locally released song of 2016"" and hot on its heels is the follow-up, ""If You Ask Me Again (I Do)."" Pierre and Mason should be no strangers to fans of modern Kansas City jazz, as they're both featured members of the ensemble Shades of Jade. Soul Revival takes their skills in new directions. We are proud to share an interview with Desmond ""D. Professor"" Mason about this new project.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourselves. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I live in Kansas City, MO. I do music full time.  </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Tell us about the origins of Soul Revival. Who does what?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Desmond: </strong>Soul Revival originated with Derick's vision, which was to bring the best KC musicians together to play soulful R&B music from the 70's until the present. I was one of those musicians, and I played piano for several of the live events Derick organized and presented. Derick and I decided to work with one another to record music when my skills in track production was witnessed by Derick. So for the live events, I play keys when I am available, and I am the main producer for the recorded music. </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Both of you are also associated with the KC jazz group Shades of Jade. How is Soul Revival an extension of your work in Shades?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Desmond: </strong> I started producing tracks while in Shades of Jade, so this group (Soul Revival) has experienced the evolution of my production craft and process from that. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/iKulJOyoEQw?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your writing process. Who’s really influencing your music right now?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I write to my feelings and if Derick wants to record over that, he does. That's how the relationship works currently. If I think a track I produced fits Derick's style and taste, I just send it to him and then he'll decide whether he wants to make a song out of it or not. As far as my process, I usually start with a melodic or percussive loop, and then build a hook or verse around that. Then once I have that verse or hook built, I build all of the other elements around that, adding or subtracting instrumentation to make the track an ""Out D. Park""experience (Out D. Park Productions is the name of my production company). </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/307400679&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>KC artists shout-outs:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Shoutout to producers/musicians xj-will, MaxxMarvel, Dominique Sanders, DawgBeats, D'Jawns, Jamial Black, Kemet The Phantom, Leonard D'Stroy, Jeff Stocks, and others for pushing me to become excellent at music production! </p><br /><br /><p>Shoutout to artists Derick Pierre, Tasha The Lipstick Killer, Jessica Ayala, Paula Saunders, Kemet the Phantom, Kadesh Flow, Duncan Burnett, Isaiah Yurking, Clark Roosevelte, and others I forgot but love for being dope! </p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Desmond's music recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1445379036_malibu"">Malibu</a></strong></em> by Anderson .Paak,</p><br /><br /><p><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1471442036_blank_face_lp""><em><strong>Blank Face </strong></em></a><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1471442036_blank_face_lp"">LP</a> </strong></em>by<em><strong> </strong></em>Schoolboy Q, </p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/sr%20pic2-2.jpg"" width=""2513"" height=""2691"" alt=""Soul Revival"" title=""Soul Revival"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div></div>","0","437","1","1490276846","1490277050","0","0","Pop|R and B - Soul","rhythm and blues|soul","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/soul-revival","https://www.soulrevivalmusic.com/","Learn more about Soul revival here."

What was that process like?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Come Alive is the single I released in May of 2016. I recorded it at JTL Group in Grandview, MO with Aaron Cooper, a crazy talented producer.</p><br /><br /><p>I’m proud of that song not just because of the great quality, writing and production but I love how much I grew as an artist from the process of writing it. I was pushed outside of my comfort zone the entire time.  Admittedly,  working in the studio was in initially  intimidating. My writing was still in a very premature state when I arrived at JTL and so was my confidence. I sat In a room with a few studio writers and wrote a couple days out of the week… Just to get my feet wet. I had never been in a writing session before then. It’s an interesting kind of safe space that I don’t think you ever truly get used to. It’s a space where every idea is encouraged to be heard even if the original idea doesn’t make the final cut. I feel like I could talk about it for days and never really describe it really, but there’s something beautiful about creating together.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/r-aRyDxrtpo?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You’ve shared many cover versions of songs you love, from Etta James to Ed Sheeran to Ben E. King. How have these artists shaped you as a songwriter?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Etta James, wow.  When I hear Etta James sing, it’s as if I was there during that beautiful, tragic experience she’s singing about. I love the simplicity of her music and the rawness and pain in her voice. The music that backs her is always beautiful but I think she tells the story in her voice. As a songwriter, right now I usually lean towards less is more when layering instruments. Ed Sheeran also has an beautiful way of telling stories and I think he showcases that best through his lyrics and that falsetto as well. And Ben E. King - my feelings towards him are similar to those of Etta James. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/9h466dLH2HU?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How much progress have you made toward your first EP? What can fans expect in 2017?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Well, last year when I set out to record and EP, I actually really didn’t have songs written. The goal was to write them at the studio but I didn’t raise enough money to produce a full EP so we released a single instead. But now It’s different story. I have enough songs to record the full EP now. I do plan on launching another campaign in efforts to raising the funds but I don’t have any dates set as of now. I’m excited about this project because It’s about some of the biggest moments in my life this past year.</p><br /><br /><p>I think the biggest thing people can expect in 2017 is me playing more of my own music. Playing covers forever can kill the soul. I’m backed by a band now so that’s different and I guess I’m just experimenting with the sound and musicians I have. The band consists of four us and we’ve got some folk/indie/pop thing going on with the same soul vocals you recognize. There are some sweet, sweet harmonies floating around too. I’ll be playing some well known local festivals too, I’m pretty excited about that. In some way It makes me feel like I’m really apart of what’s happening here in KC. So yeah,expect me to release music and play more shows and have a stronger social media presence… that’s important.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>What inspires you about music in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Music in Kansas City is collaborative, evolving, appreciated, welcomed, encouraged, and growing. I don’t think KC has arrived but KC doesn’t give up and keeps going. So I guess, the future and the drive excites me as well. Genres blend like crazy here and people aren’t scared of it. Music here encourages me to keep singing, keep writing, to reach out to other musicians, learn and create together. It encourages me to go out and support other musicians </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/S0YitR1iSj0?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Crystal's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1319105036_the_artisan_soul"">The Artisan Soul</a></strong></em> <strong>by Erwin Raphael</strong></p><br /><br /><p>This book has dramatically impacted the way I view myself as an artist and creator not just with my music but with my life.

This only begins to describe their lovely and thoughtful folk songs, which touch on such influences as Innocence Mission and Sufjan Stevens. Comprised of Nash High, Melinda Lavenau and Mark Coulter, the trio is one of Kansas City's hidden treasures. We are happy to share an interview with and recommendations from Nash and Melinda. Enjoy.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourselves. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>	<strong>Nash:</strong> We're a trio from Lee's Summit, consisting of Nash High (vocals, guitar), Melinda Lavenau (vocals, violin, glockenspiel), and Mark Coulter (percussion).  Mark lives in Oak Grove and studies Film at the University of Central Missouri.  He is also one half of Los Coulters, a Latin music group formed by him and his brother.  Melinda lives in Lee's Summit, where she works for Haiti Home of Hope, a non-profit organization founded by her church.  I recently moved to Kansas City to work for Kansas City Public Library.<br /><br /><br />	 <br /><strong>Tell us about the origins of Tiny Escalators. Who brings what to the table?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>	<strong>Nash:</strong> Tiny Escalators started with a cassette tape of 6 demos. They were a different sound than the songs I had previously written, and I decided I needed to recruit some help on them. Mark and I have been friends since grade school and had played music together in the past. Mark built the bucket drums for Los Coulters, and it seemed to be a good fit for these songs.  I knew Melinda from the local coffee shop, where she used to work.  We had talked about music quite a bit, as we each played and wrote songs on our own.  We met up to see what we could make of the songs, and next thing we know we're Tiny Escalators.<br /><br /><br />	 </p><br /><br /><p>	 </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/219420689&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What goes into the making of your “soft strange songs”? Where do you record your music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>	<strong>Nash:</strong> I write the songs for voice and guitar.  When I bring them to the band, they're just skeletons -- I have no idea how they're going to end up.  Melinda asks, ""What do you want me to do?"", and I say, ""I don't know. Whatever you want.""  We play around with it and figure out what we like, and eventually it starts coming together.</p><br /><br /><p>	We generally record in my living room. I fluctuate between wanting to build a fuller, tidier, studio sort of sound, and wanting to take a more organic approach and just record us all playing through a song.  For our album, <em>Tiny Apartment Recordings</em>, we wanted to capture the feel of a house show, so that's how we recorded it -- just set up the mics & started playing, but we also included ""studio"" versions (albeit still recorded in a living room) of a few songs, which we recorded track-by-track and added in extra vocal layers and instruments.</p><br /><br /><p>	 </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/208038046&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you about music in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>	<strong>Melinda</strong>: I love how the Midwestern spirit of kindness and hard work translates to a lot of support and fangirling of other bands while we each hone our own.</p><br /><br /><p>	<strong>Nash</strong>: Kansas City as a whole is that weird blend of city hubbub and small-town closeness, and that definitely shows in our local music realm.  There's a lot going on here: lots of opportunities and venues, and lots of music being made, but people are also really warm and inviting about it, so there's a strong sense of community here.</p><br /><br /><p>	 </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196421335&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p>And here are our recommendations:</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Melinda:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>1. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/168563036_franny_and_zooey"">Franny and Zooey</a></strong> </em>by J.D.

What was this experience like? How closely did you work with each producer?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>To tell the truth I didn't get to sit down with all the producers liked I originally had planned to. Only guys I really got to sit down with were Rick Maun, Geesace and Ace Fadal. All who I consider great musical friends of mine. We all managed to create three solid pieces too. All with a different sound and direction but still managed to find the right sounds to coexist on one project.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/qr05R_OmSJY?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe your creative process and the technology you use to build songs. What tool or app have you recently been raving about?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My creative process can be described in one word. Repetition. When I write to songs I listen to them over and over. When building albums I'll listen to the same playlist of songs for months, listening as if I'm waiting for something to change or take shape in my minds eye. I'll  write the tracklist down everyday just to make it a reality in my mind. Any and every chance I get I'm formulating a plan to be a better me.</p><br /><br /><p>Far as apps it's funny you say that cause recently my laptop crashed so I've been running my entire brand off my phone. I use the basics of social medias to promote most days. Apps like Pages Manager really help me connect and look as polished as possible. When it comes to technologies I leave that to my engineer at Industry Soundz Studio, MAB. He uses pro tools and after all these years of staring at this program while he mixes my tracks you'd think I'd  be pretty seasoned as well. Unfortunately that's not the case. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/295669263&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Talk about the major inspirations behind your work.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Well besides petty things like revenge, I'd say some of the major inspirations behind my work would all center around my life experiences. What I've  been through and what I'm into. Video games and anime for example are some of the core things that I'm into. So I combine those things with my upbringing and blend the realities of my dream world along with the real one. That is a shallow explanation of a form of my expression but I assure you it is therapeutic. Music has healed deep scars and wounds I've obtained in my life in my 25 years of living and I am forever grateful. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/254704301&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you the most about KC’s hip-hop and rap community</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Things like seeing people I've known since they were young kids performing these days.

While <em>Waves</em> is purely a solo effort (he performed all the music himself), it is by no means the work of an amateur. These songs are polished and ready for airtime. We're excited to share an interview Keaton Conrad about his new music, how it was recorded and what he appreciates most about music in Kansas City. Enjoy!</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Keaton Conrad, and I'm a musician, artist, composer, and high school student. I currently live and work in Lenexa, Kansas.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Talk about the time between your debut EP, </strong><em><strong>Panic & Blame,</strong></em><strong> and your new full length, </strong><em><strong>Waves.</strong></em><strong> How did you grow as a songwriter? What influenced the new songs?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>With <em>Panic & Blame</em>, the main focus for me was putting out the best quality and most commercially friendly songs possible. However, looking back on them now, the songs seem very structured to me. Not bad by any means, just structured. Being only 15 at the time of release, I didn't really know much about using emotion to one's advantage when writing. I thought for a while about how to make my next album really carve my own style into the industry. I eventually realized that the songs that meant the most to me were deep-rooted in emotion and had a certain weight to them - they weren't just another pop song. I toyed with writing in the months after that and eventually realized that the songs that expressed myself and my emotions were the ones that were the best, not the ones that had the most commercial viability. This idea is actually the inspiration for both the songs ""Biscayne"" and ""Eccentric"" off of <em>Waves</em>. It was this realization that I write what I feel that helped me to grow as a songwriter in the time between <em>Panic & Blame</em> and <em>Waves</em>. I wanted to ensure the new album felt natural and organic. The entire new album is based on me, my emotions, and my thoughts - if I didn't feel it, it didn't make it on the album, and there were several songs that I cut because they didn't meet these criteria.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Where and how was the new album recorded? What were some of the creative challenges you encountered during the recording process?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em>Waves</em> was recorded in my home studio, which is also where I recorded <em>Panic & Blame</em>. The biggest challenge I encountered while recording was not having all the instruments at my disposal. My studio is relatively small and doesn't have room for a drum set or any big instruments like that. Virtual instruments helped a lot with this, though, and every bass track, every synth and piano track, and almost every drum and percussion track was sampled and played on a computer. I think software like this really helps people like me who don't have 24/7 access to a professional recording studio still be able to make music. Technology has kind of revolutionized the industry.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/DOvx8-0wwwQ?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Who do you look to for inspiration? What album or artist are you currently raving about?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>First and foremost, I look to myself, my current state of life, and my environment for inspiration. Then I focus on relationships, girls, and other interpersonal stuff second. To me, this is actually the hard way to do it, but it gives the best results in my opinion. Anyone can write a breakup song, but it's the details, emotions, and drama added that really make the good songs stand out from the bad ones.</p><br /><br /><p>I have a kind of love/hate relationship with inspiration. It doesn't really cooperate at convenient times. I have to go out and catch it sometimes, wrestle it and bring it back to my studio. And in the case of writer's block, which happens more often than not, there's really nothing I can do except wait it out. But when inspiration does finally work to my advantage, it's a very freeing feeling like no other. This struggle formed the basis for the song ""Biscayne"" and ""Eccentric"", which both took months to finish writing, as the inspiration for them would be fleeting at best.</p><br /><br /><p>As for other artists, I'm always raving about Bon Iver. <em>22, A Million</em> is an innovative and intricate album, and I strive to someday reach that level of expressiveness.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/304743586&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you about music in Kansas City? </strong></p><br /><br /><p>Musicians in Kansas City are very supportive of each other. It's not like some cut-throat audition in Hollywood where everyone is trying to sabotage each other. We all respect each other's craft, and are cooperative and collaborative for the most part. We're all willing to work together to put on great shows or promote albums or whatever the case may be. I think it's the ""We're all in this together"" vibe that inspires me the most about KC.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/Keaton-Conrad.jpg"" width=""1280"" height=""1600"" alt=""Keaton Conrad"" title=""Keaton Conrad"" />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-caption-caption--field-image-with-caption.tpl.php -->    Keaton Conrad        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/304743573&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Films:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1065604036_inception""><em>Inception</em></a></strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/849306036_somewhere_in_time""><em>Somewhere in Time</em></a></strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/951081036_up""><em>Up</em></a></strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Books:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/975353036_the_maze_runner""><em>The Maze Runner</em></a></strong> by James Dashner</p><br /><br /><p><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/309158036_animal_farm""><em>Animal Farm</em></a></strong> by George Orwell</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Music</strong>:</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1139890036_the_dark_side_of_the_moon"">Dark Side of the Moon</a></strong> </em>by<em> </em>Pink Floyd  </p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1387097036_to_pimp_a_butterfly"">To Pimp a Butterfly</a></strong> </em>by<em> </em>Kendrick Lamar </p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1280880036_am"">AM</a></strong> </em>by<em> </em>Arctic Monkeys </p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1422355036_wiped_out""> Wiped Out!</a></strong> </em>by<em> </em>The Neighbourhood </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/304743582&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>","0","437","1","1492634510","1492695585","0","0","Alternative|Pop|Rock|Singer - Songwriter","pop|alternative","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/keaton-conrad","http://www.keatonconradmusic.com/","Learn more about Keaton Conrad here."

Kansas City is much more than most portray, which is unfortunate but it makes sense at the same time, I guess. Shout out to the few that keep a foot on the street in order to actually relate. They know like I know.

Photo by Anna Selle        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div>    <p><a href=""http://www.lennonbone.com/"">Lennon Bone</a> is a songwriter, musician, producer and engineer who has toured the U.S. and Europe as drummer for the band Ha Ha Tonka as well as performing at Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits and SXSW, to name a few. Needless to say, Bone's a multifaceted artist. His newest single, ""Cut the Line"" is a heartwrenching tribute to his late mother that is also a great gem of a pop song. We're honored to share an interview with Lennon Bone about this song as well as his other endeavors and forthcoming EP. Enjoy!</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong><em>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</em></strong></p><br /><br /><p>My name is Lennon. I live in Kansas City, KS. I record and produce bands and songwriters out of Element Recording in KC MO, and I'm the owner of a commercial music company called Sound and Patterns Music that I run from Element and my home office. I round out my time as a freelance drummer for various studio projects, bands, etc. <br /><br /><br />	 </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong><em>Talk about your new single ""Cut the Line"" which was inspired by the death of your mother. How did creating this song help you through the grieving process?</em></strong></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Well, I think writing it just felt necessary. Not to be a Debbie Downer, but necessary like a good cry is necessary when you're dealing with something that hits you so hard that it throws you backward. Now, this is going to sound like it's straight out of the Bon Iver playbook, but that was never the intention. After mom passed, I needed some time to just get away and be by myself. A guy by the name JT Murrell was kind enough to offer me a place that he and his family stays out in Wisconsin for a few days. I packed up some recording gear and just went and hung out. Did some hiking. A bunch of writing. A lot of thinking. It's the probably the only time I've been able to really be alone with my thoughts and fairly isolated from people I know. Cut The Line was the first one I wrote. There were quite a few more, so I'm planning to finish those for an EP release sometime late spring/early summer. </p><br /><br /><p>	I've been so thankful for the kind words from people about the tune, and how it's touched some who have dealt with similar issues. Not to mention 90.9 The Bridge adding it to their main rotation. I've been pretty floored by the reception, really. <br /><br /><br />	 </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/_jeoXv9PKds?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong><em>You are a multi-instrumentalist, composer and producer. I wonder if you can speak to any challenges you face as a composer in light of your collaborative and behind-the-scenes work. Do you find switching creative gears easy?</em></strong></p><br /><br /><p>	I mean, yeah... I find switching gears pretty easy. But each thing gets it's own space. I've learned to block off certain days that are really only for certain things, which allows me to keep my focus over that time. But the nice thing is that if I start to get bored or stuck on something, I usually have another project that allows me to take myself out of a scenario and get a fresh perspective. Then when I go back, I'm able to be more focused and have a better sense of what's happening.</p><br /><br /><p>	The problem with things like composition and mixing is that you can so easily get caught in the most minute details and lose sight of what the big picture is. When I'm doing something like playing drums for somebody, I'm acting on impulses and seeing things from a much bigger picture. Mostly because I don't have time to sit down and nitpick things... I just have to be ready to act fast. Doing production with bands and songwriters is the same way. I like to move quick and use more broad stroke moves. I don't want the artist to get bogged down with details that don't matter... so in those roles I get to think bigger picture more often. I think being able to have parts of my brain that do both the small picture and big picture things keeps me balanced. <br /><br /><br />	 </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/264969190&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong><em>Can you point to one time in your life where you knew you wanted to be a songwriter and producer? Who or what inspired you early on to create music?</em></strong></p><br /><br /><p>	Probably the first memory I have of wanting to be a musician was being in about 6th grade and seeing my dad play bass at BB Kings Club in Memphis, TN. I immediately fell in love with the blues, and wanted to be the drummer right away. It was like he (the drummer) got to just hang back and make everything feel good while the guitar player did all the real work. I think that analogy still fits my personality very well. I've always loved trying to make someone else look better. Playing a supporting role as either a player or a producer is so much fun because I get to just look for ways to make what's there work. I get to bridge the gaps and see someone get excited because an idea that they had just became way cooler to them because of an idea that I had. Collaboration is the most beautiful thing in that way. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Since then I'd say that there have been little tells all throughout my life that have pointed me in one direction or another. The trick is trusting your gut and being willing to put some eggs in the basket, do the work, and learn the craft in order to try and make it financially feasible. I mean, I do all of this because I love it, but love alone doesn't pay the bills or feed my kids. Because of my love for what I do and the need to provide for me and my family, I'm constantly feeling like I'm needing to continue to learn, and then something I learn will sometimes point me in a new direction. So I either go after that thing, or I don't. But if I do, I'm always willing to really invest time into it so that I can REALLY see how it's going to play out. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>I just feel so lucky to do what I do for a living, and feel like I owe it to myself to try and make myself as good as I can at whatever it is I'm working on. <br /><br /><br />	 </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1403961987/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://lennonbone.bandcamp.com/album/a-great-offer"">A Great Offer by The Mayor of Strawberry Hill</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong><em>What else can your fans expect from you in 2017?</em></strong></p><br /><br /><p>	Well, I'm currently producing 2 EP's with the hope of 2 full lengths to start recording soon. I don't want to say who those are yet. I like to give the artists a chance to make announcements as it all comes around... but you can follow me on my website for more info on those as they happen. </p><br /><br /><p>	I'll be releasing my solo EP in the late Spring or early Summer. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>I'm working on a project with another Kansas City drummer, Brendan Culp. He used to play in Making Movies. We've been writing a bunch of really weird instrumental music, and just having a blast. We should be releasing our first track, along with an official project announcement very soon. We're not sure where the project is headed, we're just trying to create something completely for fun. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>I also got the great privilege to play on Claire Adams (Bass for Katy Guillen and The Girls / Claire and the Crowded Stage) latest project. I'll be doing some shows with her coming up, and she's been singing on some of my stuff as well. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Not to mention continuing to do composition for commercial projects and what not. If you're reading this and do video work, please contact me directly! I'd love to chat about what you do and how I could serve you! </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><br /><br />	 </p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong><em>What excites you the most about the Kansas City-area music scene?</em></strong></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>There's so much potential in this area, and we're seeing more growth with things like Boulevardia, the new Record Bar location, Middle of the Map Fest, Midcoast Takeover, etc. etc. I think a local scene grows when it brings in national attention, so these are things that are helping that happen. I've always said how much I dislike the term ""local"" when it's paired with events and music. Mostly because I think people that don't know how good our local scene is immediately think that because someone is ""local"", they're not as talented as someone that's ""national"". I've experienced this with being in a touring band for 10 years. However, these events, as well as awesome radio opportunities like 90.9 The Bridge are putting our best ""local"" talent directly alongside ""national"" talent in a way that people don't necessarily know which is which. It just let's them see something and either like it or not without the preconceived notions. That's what allows artists and bands to really create a following in their hometown, while also having the music lovers learn to TRUST our scene and what's out there.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Lennon's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Books </strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/841475036_the_war_of_art"">The War of Art</a></strong></em> by Steven Pressfield </p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1173323036_art_amp_fear"">Art and Fear</a></strong></em> by David Bayles (Warning :: Could change your life.)</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/377734036_the_power_of_now"">The Power of Now</a></strong></em> by Eckhart Tolle</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Music </strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1471474036_the_party"">The Party</a></strong></em> by Andy Shauf </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Movies </strong><br /><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/524788036_tom_dowd_amp_the_language_of_music"">Tom Dowd and the Language of Music</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/0009584543_10.jpg"" width=""1200"" height=""800"" alt=""Lennon Bone"" title=""Lennon Bone"" />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-caption-caption--field-image-with-caption.tpl.php -->    Lennon Bone.

Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I’m Chloe, hello! I’m 21 and I live in Kansas City. I’m a singer and a songwriter. I moved here from San Jose, CA, about six years ago and lived most of my life in the Bay Area and in southern California. Some of the most important years have been here, though. I’ve been working a bunch of odd jobs lately, nannying and such. Whatever is flexible enough so I can still work on music. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/262684512&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Talk about your most recent single, ""National News."" Where was it recorded? What did you learn from recording this song that you'll take to future projects?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I self-recorded ""National News"" at JTL Group in Grandview. I can walk there from my house, it rocks. Jared Logan is a good buddy of mine and has always been really generous to me with his space. It’s like a little oasis. I started writing ""National News"" when I was in Nashville for a project a couple of years ago. It was at Blackbird Studios in the hallway, in front of the bathroom. I wrote part of the first verse and forgot about it. I think that was almost three years ago actually. It was a song that I would work on or just think about when I was taking a break from something else. There was a point last year when I was writing a lot and recording more. All just demos. I started recording ""National News"" as a demo that I could stick on Soundcloud. Some friends that also work at JTL helped me polish up the mix and I used LANDR to master it. I think I felt like the song had to be something else or the production needed to be at another place before I could put it in a real marketplace. It probably would have stayed on Soundcloud forever had I not received a few great pieces of advice which encouraged me otherwise. Also one of my best friends is a yoga instructor and she wanted to put it on a Spotify playlist for her classes (LOL).  If I learned anything from the whole experience, it’s that I make a lot of arbitrary rules for myself. I’ve always pictured making a record or releasing music as being this romantic, grandiose flourish. I guess nothing makes it that, you just have to decide that it is. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/260454493&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>When did you start writing songs? </strong></p><br /><br /><p>I think I starting writing songs when I was in junior high. They all came from poems. I would just play my nylon string Spanish guitar that I got in 3rd grade and sing. I didn’t try to make it anything, I just remember it feeling good. I didn’t really try until I was maybe a junior in high school. Voice memos are my best friend. It all began with voice memos that I recorded while I was driving around or awkwardly in a corner where no one could hear me singing gibberish into my phone. Yes, I know that is almost directly a Taylor Swift quote, but oh well. There was always music around me as a kid.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/299576954&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Who were your earliest influences?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Neither one of my parents are musicians but they both had music they really loved and shared with me. My mom loves classic rock like Queen and Heart and Zeppelin. She always talked about David Bowie and Flock of Seagulls. I have an Irish claddagh ring that she found on the ground at an X concert when she was my age. My parents were both obsessed with U2. My dad definitely went through a Johnny Cash phase and it was played at all times.</p><br /><br /><p>I’ve always been obsessed with Feist. I think like everyone my age, I discovered her because of the iPod nano commercial. She was one the first artists that I can remember really, really gripping me. The Reminder has been on loop for the last 10 years. And it’s the fact that she made the whole record in a pretty house in the French countryside. It was kind of this haphazard process that was also completely intentional. It embodies everything that compels me into art in general. It made me want to make music that was vivid and visceral. I was also a big fan of Suzanne Vega, the Cranberries, the Beach Boys. I loved the Killers and the White Stripes and the Yeah Yeah Yeah’s. I went through a phase where I listened to a lot of orchestral rock and classical composers. I used to watch Soul Train reruns on TV. I’ve always loved jazz. I used to have to sit at the back of the classroom and listen to jazz compilation CD’s in headphones because I couldn’t focus in class. I was kind of all over the place, music- taste- wise and otherwise. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/198638801&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How has your songwriting grown in terms of collaborations with other artists?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I’ve gotten to do a lot of writing for other artists in the last couple of years. It’s been super fun. There has been a lot of pop artists, some R&B. I got to write on Crystal Rose’s song “Come Alive”. She’s such an incredible vocalist and so ridiculously hard working. She is the most rewarding kind of artist to work with. It’s the greatest feeling to pour your soul into something that is actually being used and played live. I’m lucky to have a lot of really talented producers as friends. I have a couple different collaborations that are being released this year. I did a feature on an EDM track with the group Pop Culture. The song is called “Million Miles”. I’m working on a record with Jared Logan, who I mentioned before. His background as a producer is really broad.</p><br /><br /><p>What we’re making is kind of like soul, alternative- pop. It’s some of my favorite music I’ve ever worked on. It’s very equally balanced between the two of us. I’ve always wished I was in a band. What me and Jared are doing kind of settles that. I much prefer to do things with other people than by myself. I think a huge part of making a record of any kind is the people that you’re with.

We caught up with the band as they celebrate the release of their debut album, <em>Moving in Color.  </em>Enjoy!</p><br /><br /><p><em>*</em></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Describe your music for new listeners. Who are your influences?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>We consider ourselves a funk rock band, but as we evolve and write more music, we find ourselves exploring genres a bit outside of our comfort zone. We take great pride in our ability to add improvisation into our live sets, write songs as a group, and incorporate a wide range of influences from each band member. This helps give us a unique and original sound.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Our most common comparison is with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, one of our favorite bands.  Our influences range from ""jam"" bands (Grateful Dead, Widespread Panic), hip hop (Tupac, Beastie Boys, Wu Tang Clan), 90s grunge/nu metal bands (311, Soundgarden, Nirvana), and 80s synth pop (Human League, Depeche Mode) just to name a few.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/306129765&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Talk about the recording of your new album, <em>Moving in Color.</em> What did you learn that you’ll take to future projects?</strong></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>We learned a lot about patience.  Making an album takes a lot of hard work and it takes time.  The full process includes scheduling, tracking, mixing, mastering, graphic design, replication, distribution, and promotion.  And after going through that process, we have learned that creativity should never be rushed or forced.  Often times, the best material will not be something that we sat there and drilled on for hours, but rather ideas that come to us periodically during times of inspiration.  Also, in the studio we had a lot of time to explore and gain new perspectives on the songs by incorporating new vocal harmonies, as well as new keyboard and auxiliary percussion parts that the four of us could not  have played live.  We liked the new parts so much that we recently brought on a fifth band member (Tim Kohl) to recreate those sounds and more going forward.   </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/306129760&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How does songwriting work in The Uproot?</strong></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>When we first started years ago as a trio (without vocals), all of our songs came from jamming.  One person would come up with a riff then we'd start playing around with that riff until we came up with some changes and alternate parts.  Once we had the changes down, we would develop an arrangement and the shell of the song was born.</p><br /><br /><p>Currently, Ham, T Switz, or I will write a riff or an entire song on our own, record it with our phones, then send it to the band.  Then we will listen to it individually to come up with new guitar or bass parts on our own before meeting together as a band and coming up with a final arrangement. Once this is done, we will make a simple recording of the arrangement on our phones and send it to T Switz so he can write lyrics over it.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/306129768&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you the most about music in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>We are inspired by the fact that Kansas City was known as ""The Vegas of the Plains"" during the Prohibition era, which allowed the jazz scene to thrive here. Music is one thing that makes this city great. There are great musical acts to see nearly every single night in this city and its surrounding areas. Anyone who is up past 3AM on friday/saturday night should attend the jam sessions at Mutual Musicians Foundation. It is a truly electrifying experience to witness these incredibly talented musicians improvise, you can definitely feel the authenticity and passion in their music.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/_MG_4716.jpg"" width=""1000"" height=""667"" alt=""The Uproot"" title=""The Uproot"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div>    <p><strong>The Uproot's book and film recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1330950036_under_the_skin"">Under the Skin </a></strong></em>directed by Jonathan Glazer</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1400198036_ex_machina"">Ex Machina</a></strong></em> directed by Danny Boyle</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&t=title&search_category=title&q=last+picture+show&searchOpt=catalogue"">The Last Picture Show</a></strong></em>, book written by Larry McMurtry, film by Peter Bogdonovich</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1483879036_oj"">OJ: Made in America</a></strong></em>, directed by Ezra Edelman</p><br /><br /></div>","0","437","1","1493757426","1495139907","0","0","Rock","funk|rock","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/uproot","https://theuproot.bandcamp.com/releases","Learn more about The Uproot here."

A gifted singer who counts Carole King and Lauryn Hill as major influences, Henehan is often found hosting regular open mics for aspiring songwriters at the Uptown Arts Bar and Davey's Uptown Rambler's Club. Her new band is named Pearl Allure and we're happy to share their debut song, the swinging jazz-folk ""Breakin' Hearts"". You can catch Pearl Allure this Saturday, May 27th, at the third annual <a href=""http://westportroots.com/"">Westport Roots Festival</a>, a fundraiser for Kansas City Pridefest.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong><br /><br /><br />	My name is Maggie Henehan. I am from Kansas City, Missouri and live in Westport. I work as a writer for American Century Investments on the plaza in their Global Products department. Out of college, a little over four years ago, I entered the industry doing client services and have been a product writer for the past two years. For music-related work, I host open mics at Uptown Arts Bar and Davey’s Uptown Rambler’s Club, aside from playing shows. </p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Tell us about the music you’re working on and recording. How long has this music been gestating?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I am currently working on about a dozen original songs that I have been writing throughout the past two and half years. I didn’t expect to compose my first song; it kind of just came out and then the songwriting unraveled from there. I suppose a childhood desire to be a singer, combined with life experience, and whole lot of emotion added up to this happening. Also, I grew up playing classical piano, have written poetry, and had a good run from time to time freestyling with friends in college. I think all of these components led me to eventually let out this deep desire to sing and make music. I find it funny and am grateful that it caught me by surprise. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/q_2dYTCchcQ?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How long have you been a songwriter? Who initially inspired and continues to inspire your music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I have been writing songs for a little over two and a half years. I have admired Carole King since I was fourteen, which was also the age I began to write poetry. In both her romantic and philosophical/societal perspectives she created this very relatable emotional landscape that commingled so well with the melodies and instrumentation of each song. I also began to love Otis Redding at this time for the intense expression in his words and voice. My parents listened to mostly classic rock when I was growing up, and I loved Tom Petty, Led  Zeppelin, Kansas, The Beatles, and Don Henley, to name a few.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Initially, though, of course… we’re talking Sheryl Crow, Jewel, Gwen Stefani, Brittany Spears, Christina Aguilera, Alanis Morissette, TLC, Mandy Moore, Shania Twain, Spice Girls, Destiny’s Child, Backstreet Boys, ‘N Sync, Mariah Carey, etc. I must say this, because I told my parents that I knew I wanted to be a singer when I was about 10 years old and I was definitely listening to these artists. When I was in high school and college (skipping over Dashboard Confessional, TBS and The Used middle school favorites), I enjoyed artists like </p><br /><br /><p>Conor Oberst, Lauryn Hill, Jenny Lewis, Jack Johnson, Modest Mouse, Feist, Tilly and the Wall, Neko Case, Amy Winehouse and Janelle Monáe. I also became familiar with classics like Dinah Washington, Billie Holiday, Etta James and Joni Mitchell.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>The answer is the same as any musician, I’m sure. Which is that they are inspired by any artist that grabbed at their heart strings and/or finished the sentences to a feeling or thought they weren’t able to quite understand or elaborate. I imagine that everyone I have ever listened to has seeped their way into my mind and into the joys and sorrows of my heart. It is hard to say who my influences are that influenced my music composition; the music just came out and was influenced by the desire to express what was going through my heart and mind at that time without targeting a specific genre or style.<br /><br /><br />	 </p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ></div></div></div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/Lf4a4m6JBOA?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Tell us about Pearl Allure. How did this project come together? What do you have planned for 2017?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I began performing publicly at open mics and jams in February of 2015 and I then started doing solo shows that August. I didn’t think I was ready for that, and was a bit hesitant, but I was encouraged to nonetheless. I then had a solo show about once a month until I started working with a band in September of 2016. It was really something to start working with talented musicians that helped contribute to the landscape of my own songs. With the very talented Dylan McGonigle initially on guitar and Tony Toigo on drums, we performed a few shows as The Maggie Henehan Band. They were the foundation of Pearl Allure and it was a pleasure to work with them both. Collectively, our individual goals led to new bandmates that now make up Pearl Allure. Robert Castillo is on bass, who has a KC jazz group of his own that was originally created in Portland, Oregon called The Sextet; Natalie Bates, from the Natalie Bates Quartet and who also plays drums for The Sextet, and Peter Marten as guitarist, who plays guitar for The Sextet. All three have been and currently are involved in multiple projects.</p><br /><br /><p><br /><br />	Our first gig as Pearl Allure will be Saturday, May 27th, at the third annual Westport Roots Festival. We will be playing that evening at the Barefoot Wine & Bubbly Stage at the Firefly Lounge. The show is a fundraiser for Kansas City Pridefest. </p><br /><br /><p>Moving forward, we will be heading back to the studio to record some tracks and hope to contribute to local shows who wish to have us. I will be working with a local filmmaker on a solo music video that I expect to release later this year.<br /><br /><br />	 </p><br /><br /><p><strong>What inspires you the most about the Kansas City music and its creative communities?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I have been hosting open mics at various locations for two years now and I am inspired by all of the musicians who get up on stage and perform, no matter what level of experience they have at the time. To see each of these members of the Kansas City community come together and build each other up, collaborate at times, and find joy in the significance of these events is what is most inspiring to me. There are so many musicians that are also poets, actors, comedians, painters, drawers, etc. and together make up and contribute to a beautiful Venn diagram of the arts in Kansas City. Art is a cornerstone of a successful and thriving city and it has been beautiful to watch that evolve in our own town.  </p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Maggie's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/514852036_the_book_of_laughter_and_forgetting"">The Book of Laughter & Forgetting</a></strong></em> by Milan Kundera</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1027918036_the_archandroid"">The ArchAndroid</a></strong></em> by Janelle Monáe</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/353196036_what_dreams_may_come"">What Dreams May Come</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1326638036_the_lego_movie"">The Lego Movie</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/866363036_princess_mononoke"">Princess Mononoke</a></strong></em></p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/17103701_10158570344780393_6747719639811028849_n_0.jpg"" width=""822"" height=""960"" alt=""Maggie Henehan"" title=""Maggie Henehan"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div></div>","0","437","1","1495645359","1495744857","0","0","Folk - Americana|Jazz|Singer - Songwriter","folk|jazz","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/maggie-henehan","",""

Their first album, <em>The Wires, </em>was released in 2013 and they are currently finishing a follow-up in addition to performing, teaching and other music-related projects.

We slowly piece our work together over weeks or months.  We don't have any of our tunes transcribed (yet) - it's all just floating around in our brains! What's surprising about our pieces (even to us), is the length they take to complete.  We have lofty goals about finishing certain songs, and then it ends up taking weeks or months (or years).</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/IHK3fI2l7vg?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Your first album, <em>The Wires¸ </em>was released in 2012.

The strength of their music makes the grim news of the passing of lead singer and guitarist Jacob Garrett last month even grimmer. The remaining members of Clearview have decided to dissolve the band.

This trio of ""non-virtuosos"" play an eclectic assortment of instruments, ranging from clarinet, trumpet and double bass to the flugelhorn and ocarina. Together, the trio -- comprised of David D. McIntire, Ryan Oldham and Brian Padavic -- rely on strong chemistry and an almost ""telepathic"" connection to each other to produce their irreproducible not-quite-jazz, not-quite classical experimental sounds. In this interview, Ryan Oldham walks us through EIO's unique approach to music-making.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>For the uninitiated, what is Ensemble of Irreproducible Outcomes? Who’s involved? How did the Ensemble originate?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>EIO (we usually refer to ourselves in abbreviated form) is comprised of David D. McIntire (clarinet, saxophones, ocarina, electronics), Ryan Oldham (trumpets, flugelhorn, whistling, objects) and Brian Padavic (double bass, tanpura raagini). The trio was formed in the wake of an attempt by David D. McIntire to compose a piece for double bass and electronics (never finished). He invited Padavic to come to his house and record some bass sounds, which McIntire planned to use as raw material for the project. In the midst of this process, an idea of writing music that would be flexible in its realization (but consistent and recognizable) took hold, and Oldham was added to the mix. We’ve done a lot of performing for a group of our sort, and really developed a strong chemistry, which is our greatest asset. The manner in which we can anticipate each others’ playing and spontaneously connect with each other borders on the telepathic. We are probably best categorized as “non-virtuosos,” but we can all do fairly interesting things on our instruments, and we’ve all grown a lot as players since we began playing together.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"" src=""http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2185664905/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3886691621/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://recordings.irritablehedgehog.com/album/memory-and-weather"">Memory and Weather by Ensemble of Irreproducible Outcomes</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Tell us about EIO’s first album <em>Memory and Weather.</em> How long had it been in the works? Where was it recorded?</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em>Memory and Weather</em> was recorded over five days in July of 2014. It included most of the repertoire that we had composed for ourselves since forming in 2012.  We performed in four shows at the Fringe Festival that summer so we were in good form, and then recorded, with our composer friend Jon Robertson engineering. We were really pleased with the project, though we probably all feel like we could do it a lot better now… A sort of “companion album” consisting of several versions of McIntire’s arrangement of the Irish folk song ""The Foggy Dew"" also resulted from those sessions. We thought that this provided a good window into our methods, and was surprisingly satisfying as a listening experience. Last February, we released a digital album of our performance in Buffalo’s Silo City, a large grain silo that has been re-purposed into a performance space. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe style=""border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"" src=""http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=523635068/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1149401473/transparent=true/"" seamless=""""><a href=""http://recordings.irritablehedgehog.com/album/foggy-foggy-dew"">Foggy, Foggy Dew by Ensemble of Irreproducible Outcomes</a></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What is EIO’s approach to composition? Is it entirely collaborative? What balance does EIO strike between improvisation and composition?</strong></p><br /><br /><p> EIO’s members all compose for the group. To this point, nearly all of our repertoire has been composed by trio members, though this is changing a bit. A few compositions are collaborative, but mostly each member composes on their own and brings the new piece to rehearsal. We play through things together and then go back and revise. We try to create works that emphasize our strengths as players and are fun to play together. Most pieces go through several layers of us playing through drafts, followed by revision. We’ve developed a good sense of the sort of pieces that we’re good at, while continuing to expand the trio’s expressive range. We are beginning to do more jazz compositions, or write things that probably resemble jazz to most people. Ornette Coleman’s “Lonely Woman” was the first one, which Padavic transcribed shortly after Coleman died. We aren’t jazz musicians in the truest sense of the term, but we’ve all been shaped by different jazz artists and composers. We have an arrangement of David Bowie’s “Lazarus,” Zappa’s “King Kong,” and we’re working on a couple new ones. We try to find material that we can make work in terms of the trio dynamic, that feels very natural to us. This tends to be stuff that lies outside the mainstream of most rock or jazz. </p><br /><br /><p>The last question is difficult to answer in that while there is a lot of improvisation in our work, it is shaped by the idea that each piece should be consistent in affect and recognizable from performance to performance. How we solve that equation varies a lot from piece to piece. We have a range of expression that allows us to fit in a wide variety of contexts. We’ve played on rock bills in clubs, performed in galleries and the usual “alternative spaces” that groups like us gravitate towards, as well as peoples’ homes, universities, etc. We are probably most comfortable in informal and non-academic settings, though we have about ten music degrees between us. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/309774247&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What plans does EIO have for the rest of 2017 and beyond?</strong></p><br /><br /><p> We plan to tour the northeast this fall and record extensively in the Silo City performance spaces in Buffalo NY. We’ve easily got another album’s-worth of new material that we will record when we feel like we’ve settled into it enough. The next album will probably be a bit more consistent in its material, less experimental on the surface. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/318334487&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What makes Kansas City a great place for improvisational and experimental music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>KC has nurtured us in a number of ways. We all did work in the composition department at UMKC and we’ve found the city to be rich in opportunities of various sorts.

Her songs are radio-ready even without an official album release. We are grateful to Scott for taking away from performing and recording to share some insights into her creative life and inspirations.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Where do you live and work?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Hey! I’m Lauren Scott. I’m 23, and a recent college graduate making the transition into making being a musician a full time occupation.<br /><br /><br />	 </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Describe your music for new listeners. Who are your influences?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I’d like to say my music is a blend of several genres, but you'll mostly hear pop and r&b threads throughout it. I really, really love country music. I think country has been the most influential to my songwriting next to pop. My parents gave me a real love for Motown and classic rock because . I’d have to say Alicia Keys, Gwen Stefani, Natasha Bedingfield are artists that shaped me as a young musician— It was so encouraging watching women who had such a heavy hand in their songwriting and their artistry. Maren Morris, Alessia Cara, and Tori Kelly are “newer” artists that I really, really appreciate now. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/308439341&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Talk about your songwriting process. What’s the biggest challenge for you artistically?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Gosh. I spent the past couple of years in a songwriting collective, collaborating with different writers and producers weekly, almost daily it felt like at times! Prior to that, I did all of my songwriting alone, on my acoustic guitar. Co-writing opened up words of creativity inside of me that I never knew were there. Writing over beats, finished productions, and different instruments challenged me to sing in different tones and explore more interesting melodies. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>With that, I’d say the biggest challenges I’ve faced lately are: 1) writing alone, and 2) not doubting myself when there’s no one in the room, to the point that I lose faith in my own ideas. Because I’m inspired by SO many genres and have so many things to say, it’s easy for me to start an idea and shelf it because I can’t always hone it in by myself. I’ve found a strength and balance in co-writing that I’m wanting to find on my own again.<br /><br /><br />	 </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/298782091&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>The songs you’ve shared on SoundCloud are stylistically eclectic – electronic elements mix with country, soul and pop.

I’d like to think that there’s something a little different about them :) I decided to post music on my SoundCloud really to display my songwriting… I’d also like to think that some of my artistry comes through in those demos, too. But they were all done with different writers/producers. The country tracks (Rodeo, First Smoke) were written/produced with my good friend Brandon Hartt, an incredible country writer in Nashville. The pop tracks (We Don’t Know) was written/produced by another good friend, Matthew Boda. <br /><br /><br />	 </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/298782289&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you about music in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I love the fact that the artists I’ve met here who are really, really pursuing a career in music are giving it all they’ve got.

The simplicity of their songs allows their singing to shine, recalling the classic harmonies of the Beach Boys and the Everly Brothers. These qualities are on full display on their newest single ""Woe to Him Who Leaves It."" We are happy to share an interview with Kaitlyn Mrasek about their music, inspirations and recording their upcoming album in Johnson County Library's Makerspace, among other things. Enjoy!</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourselves and describe your music for new listeners.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Sweet Martha is a folk trio based in Kansas City. Our music is vocally-driven and accompanied by Bradley's acoustic guitar. Occasionally, Kaitlyn gets out a glockenspiel or auto-harp and attempts to add additional elements to a song, though she hasn't been taught (self or otherwise) to play.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/315979207&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Your harmonies sound like you’ve been singing together for decades. Your most recent song “Woe to Him Who Leaves It” is a perfect example of this. Talk about how this song came to be and where it was recorded.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>'Woe to Him Who Leaves It' started when Bradley brought what would become the melody and first line of the song to Kaitlyn, and from there, Kaitlyn wrote up the rest of the lyrics while Brad wrote the music to accompany as they went. We were lucky enough to be able to record it in a small outdoor structure at Kaitlyn's then-home in Raytown, MO - the video was shot in the same day with the help and considerable talent of the band's long-time friend, Michael Martin. The song's lyrics drew from previous relationship experiences from Brad and Kaitlyn, and attempts to speak to the 'mixed bag' of moving on from a relationship that isn't working, only to begin experiencing doubt about when you will find someone you won't have to 'move on' from.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/315978409&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How do Sweet Martha songs get their sparks to the gasoline? How often do you rehearse?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Most Sweet Martha songs start with a short melody and 100% collaboration from the start. As Brad is the only one in the group that officially plays an instrument, he generally bears the brunt of writing most of the guitar parts and dynamics, while the trio is tasked with building the structure of the song with lyrics and layering harmonies. Maintaining a cohesive three-part harmony structure is difficult, so we rehearse once a week to really solidify our songs as muscle memory, gig or no gig. Sometimes, we will add additional practices for upcoming shows.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Talk about other artists who most inspire your songwriting.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>There are an incredible amount of influences on our songwriting; genre influences that we love and attempt to bring into our music as flavors include soul and R&B artists like Sam Cooke and Otis Redding, singer songwriters and pop culture icons like Jenny Lewis, Dolly Parton, Patti Page and the Talking Heads, and our overall sound tends to be influenced by vocally-driven and masterful artists like the Lone Bellow, Alison Krauss, Eisley and of course, countless others.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/315977849&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you the most about music in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>There is a lot to be inspired by as far as music goes in Kansas City. As Kaitlyn and Brooke are not native to the city (Kaitlyn moved to KC in 2012, and Brooke moved in the summer of 2016), it has been quite a refreshing thing to find so many who are so supportive of the music we make. We have been given so many opportunities to play, even from early on - local groups like Afterglow in Pleasant Hill, MO, local coffee shops in Pleasant Hill and Lee's Summit, MO, and local music events like Porchfest KC (two years in a row!). Services like the sound booth at the JoCo Library Makerspace make it really easy for bands to get their music out in front of people. Radio stations like the Bridge and the Buzz showcase local music all the time, and really promote their success with events like Middle of the Map and Folk Alliance International happening every year. There's so much going on here and it all feels collaborative rather than competitive, which is really inspirational.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/Sweet%20Martha1.jpg"" width=""640"" height=""640"" alt=""Sweet Martha"" title=""Sweet Martha"" />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div>    <p><strong>Sweet Martha's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Books </strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1135268036_the_count_of_monte_cristo"">The Count of Monte Cristo </a></strong></em>by Alexandre Dumas<em><strong> </strong></em></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/499449036_the_martian_chronicles"">The Martian Chronicles</a></strong></em> by Ray Bradbury</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/43614036_the_catcher_in_the_rye"">Catcher in the Rye</a></strong></em> by J.D.

Describe your music for new listeners.</strong></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Hi, my name is David George. I’m a Kentucky boy, but Kansas City will always be my home. I grew up in Overland Park and moved around to Seattle and Southern California and then back to KC.  I played in a local KC band called Moaning Lisa that moved to LA in 2004. Moved back to KC in 2010 and then was offered a position playing guitar for the legend John Fogerty. I did that for about a year and then left to pursue my own material.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>The music I am currently working on is straight forward rock ’n’ roll. Not that 50’s stuff or even the heavy stuff I was doing in the band Moaning Lisa, but stuff more like the Eagles or Tom Petty. I released an EP of acoustic stuff in April and plan on releasing two more this year. The next two albums get more complex; full band, horns, etc. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/K1jKO1DcWuc?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You’ve stated that your latest EP, <em>Here I Go Again,</em> takes its inspiration from John Denver and Elliot Smith. What was it about these two artists that moved you to write and record these songs?</strong></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>When I was working on the full band stuff I came across a few Elliot Smith songs and then the powerhouse John Denver tune “Rocky Mountain High” and I got sucked into the simplicity of their stuff. Both of them could write big orchestral stuff, but it was the minimalist material that inspired me. I write on the acoustic and decided some of the songs would be better suited if I just strip them down.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Talk about this “chance meeting with the Indigo Girls” years ago that set you on your musical career.</strong></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>I had just moved to Los Angeles after college to pursue a career in film/TV. My cousin had won tickets to see them, but it was a 2-hour drive…so we did it! I was blown away by the fact that they made such a huge sound out of just two guitar and voices! We managed to sneak backstage and they offered us tickets to their next show, which happened to be closer to where we lived) and met up with them a few nights later. It was then I decided I needed an acoustic guitar. I mainly just played piano, but I loved the romantic notion of just grabbing a guitar and sitting on the bluff overlooking the ocean (I think I did it once!) and proceeded to teach myself basic chords. It was still a few years down the road before I was confident enough to play in front of people, but that’s where it all started!</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/1yOZelFsim8?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>You’ve performed with a slew of notable musicians like John Fogerty, Robert Earl Keen and Don Felder of the Eagles – even at one point Paul McCartney. Do you have a memorable story about performing alongside any of these legends?</strong></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>They say don’t ever met your idols, and for the most part that’s true! When I first met John I was put off by his bitter attitude about a shitty record deal he got when he was 16 years old. Meanwhile, we were sitting in his $40 million mansion. However, the first day of auditioning/rehearsing I met a completely different person. I saw why he was the legend that he is. Up their with Dylan, Bruce, and Paul. He is a perfectionist and works his ass off. If anyone thinks playing arenas or having a hit song is cake walk, you are sorely misguided. It takes a lot of work and some people just have it. John has it.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>I blew my chance to actually have a conversation or even a handshake with Sir Paul. When I was getting into the limo to go back to my hotel he was getting out of the same vehicle and I was so stunned at the moment that I couldn’t put one word on my tongue and he walked off quickly with a little, “cheers, Mate!”</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Tell us about a song you spent the longest time on to get right. How do you move through creative blocks?</strong></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>I have a bit of John Lennon in me where if it’s not right the first take or so I move on. Every once in awhile you hit on something that just needs some work. I wrote a song years ago in LA and recorded it twice, but was never overly happy with the end results. Then a few years ago while recording my last full length, <em>Radiant Man, </em>I pulled it back out and changed the key and feel and it gelled. I think it’s one of the best songs I’ve ever put out as far as getting the message across and a solid recording. It’s called “So You”.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Creative blocks always hit at the weirdest time. Usually you don’t even know what’s happening until you step back and realize the well has dried up and time to move on to another place! I mean that metaphorically of course. Sometimes it’s just a matter of time before something kicks back in. That’s why I have my guitar hanging on the wall by my desk. I usually always pick it up. Sometimes I just set it back down. Other times… BAM!</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/uMJFHKNuaTc?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you the most about music in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>The diversity of the music in KC is unbelievably motivating and inspiring. I’m not much in to Hip Hip or even Punk, but sometimes I’ll catch an artist doing something and I really have to take a minute and absorb it. Also, the knowledge of Kansas City’s Jazz and Blues heritage keeps the fire burning. Knowing some of the greats that got their start here or made KC what it is.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p>1. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1519342036_dreaming_the_beatles"">Dreaming The Beatles</a></strong></em> by Rob Sheffield</p><br /><br /><p>2. <em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/162433036_a_confederacy_of_dunces"">A Confederacy of Dunces</a></strong></em> by John Kennedy Toole</p><br /><br /><p>3.

I always had it in my mind that we would record an EP but after we were booked to play the Smoky Hill River Fest in Salinas, KS, it became a top priority.

He gave us his full support, offering his club as a place to rehearse on Sunday mornings and play weekly on Wednesdays. We began as a trip in June of last year and added Alyssa in January of 2017. We've grown from there as a group, writing original music and expanding on our sound as a quartet.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/291669633&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Describe what a typical NBQ practice session looks like. Who composes and arranges the music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Each member comprises arrangements of tunes that they think will accentuate our sound and entertain the audience. Aryana and myself write original music and bring it to the group, but we all have input on chord structure and formatting of the tunes. We have a very free and open sound that draws a collective input from each member of the quartet. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/291669633&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Talk about the NBQ in terms of performance. How much does one performance vary from the next?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>It always depends on the venue, but we play to our audience - always. At the Green Lady Lounge on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday night, we play a high energy set and play off the energy of the audience. We also have weekly gigs at Tom's Town Distillery, which is a much different setting. Audience members are engaged, but we add more vocal tunes and lighten the dynamics. I would say we always keep the power of the music on a higher level, but change the style of which we play our tunes.</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>What’s the most challenging thing about keeping a jazz quartet together these days?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Always always always always communication and linking up the schedules of 4 different people for gigs and rehearsals. We all have other jobs and groups we play with, so finding time for us to all meet together is always a challenge but always worth it. I would say we all currently live on our digital and/or paper calendars. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/291668181&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you the most about contemporary jazz in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I wouldn't say contemporary jazz inspires me. Opportunities and people are what is most inspiring. There is always a new place to play, new challenges to face and new people to play with and meet who give you a new way to listen and play music. I would say the musical perspective of musicians is what inspires me most. </p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>Natalie's book, music and movie recommendations:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>1. <em><strong>Blues for the Orient</strong></em> by Yusef Lateef </p><br /><br /><p>2. <em><strong>Restless Adventures</strong></em> by Klaus Layer</p><br /><br /><p>3. <em><strong>This is Bossa Nova</strong></em> Netflix Documentary</p><br /><br /><p>4. <strong><em>Dialog</em></strong> by Slowy, FloFilz and 12Vince</p><br /><br /><p>(I really like German Hip Hop)</p><br /><br /><p>5. <em><strong>Taking The Soul For A Walk</strong></em> by Dafnis Prieto</p><br /><br /><p>6. <em><strong>Rising Son</strong></em> by Takuya Kuroda's  </p><br /><br /><p>7. <em><strong>Bo Knows Bo</strong></em> by Bo Jackson </p><br /><br /><p>8. <em><strong>Rifftide: The Life and Opinions of Papa Jo Jones</strong></em> by Jo Jones</p><br /><br /><p>9.  <em><strong>Blues in C Flat Minor</strong></em> by Work Your Magic </p><br /><br /><p>10. <em><strong>But Not For Me </strong></em>by<em><strong> </strong></em>Ahmad Jamal</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div>","0","437","1","1501277242","1501277242","0","0","Jazz","jazz","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/natalie-bates-quartet","",""

While the group originally met over the internet as strangers looking to connect through music, on their debut EP, ""No Fancy Pants"" they sound like they've played together for ages.  It's a pleasure to share an interview with The B Sharps on Listen Local.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourselves. Describe your music for new listeners.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Greetings to Johnson County Library patrons and everyone on the World Wide Web! We are Eva, Bill, Greg, and Nick - otherwise known as The B Sharps. We are an original band out of Kansas City which blends the genres of country, blues, folk, and pop into one uniquely distinctive sound. </p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>How did the B Sharps originate? </strong></p><br /><br /><p>The B Sharps began as a three piece in Greg's basement. We were just three random people who met on the internet and wanted to make original music. Later we decided we wanted to add a lead guitarist to enhance our sound, so we brought in Nick who has been a wonderful addition ever since. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/284815883&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>How does songwriting work with the B Sharps? Who brings what to the table?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>The B Sharps are probably most distinctive in our song writing and instrumentation. We all compose music and play multiple instruments, so we tend to rotate around depending on who is the best fit for each song. If you watch us live you'll see lots of moving around of instruments, vocalists, and so on -- it's never boring for sure! Usually whoever has a new song will just bring it into practice and we will adapt as necessary. The three songs you'll find here each were written by a different band member and feature a different vocalist. Sometimes we add harmonica, or mandolin -- and hopefully soon we will be bringing banjo into the mix! </p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>What current projects are you working on?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>We recently released a 5 song EP titled ""No Fancy Pants"", which you can purchase right now on CD baby for only 5 bucks.

No matter what kind of artist you are, there is a home for you in Kansas City. Our rich jazz and blues scene is really unmatched, and in many ways has set the stage for what we are able to do now. It is always inspiring to encounter new music in our city, and we are very excited to be able to share what we are doing with all of you!</p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Recommendations from The B Sharps from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/978835036_abbey_road"">Abbey Road</a></strong></em> by The Beatles (CD POP/ROCK Beatles Abbey)</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/963661036_the_ultimate_collection"">The Ultimate Collection</a></strong></em> by Hank Williams  (CD COUNTRY Williams Ultimate)</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1236577036_holy_fire"">Holy Fire</a></strong></em> by Foals (CD POP/ROCK Foals Holy)</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/220464036_the_very_best_of_otis_redding"">The Very Best of Otis Redding</a></strong></em> by Otis Redding (CD R&B BLUES Redding Very)</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/858776036_at_folsom_prison"">Folsom Prison</a></strong></em> by Johnny Cash (CD COUNTRY Cash Johnny)</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/284821531&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>","0","437","1","1501771247","1501771247","0","0","Blues|Country|Rock","country|folk","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/b-sharps","https://soundcloud.com/the-b-sharps","Listen to more from The B Sharps here"

Burnett's skills as a vocalist, rapper, performer and video director are on full display, and it's captivating. His upcoming debut, EP, <em>Black Boy Joy, </em>features production and instrumental work by KC's Anthony Saunders and Dominique Sanders, AKA The Xtraordinairs. We are excited to share an interview with Burnett about this EP and other topics. Enjoy.</p><br /><br /><p>*</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Please introduce yourself. Describe your music for new listeners.</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Hey. My name is Duncan Burnett and I'm a rapper/artist, musician (drums) and producer. I hail from the great city of Olathe, KS. 913rd. Ya dig! Haha </p><br /><br /><p>My music is clean, soulful, positive, passion filled, hip hop music. Drawing inspiration from rock, R&B, soul, funk, jazz and pop to create a familiar but unique sound that everyone can enjoy.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/9Oij9J1zN4Y?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Talk about the music you’ve been working on recently and your upcoming EP. What can fans expect?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>It's been a while since I've released a project. I've made three full length projects since 2014. But they never quite made the cut because of the quality, and the fact that I am still learning how to rap and create songs. I'm new to the rap game. I took a break from trying to make a project, learned a lot and built connections with people. This lead to the creation of <em>Black Boy Joy</em>, my debut EP. I had the privilege of working with two of my favorite producers/musicians/artist Anthony Saunders and Dominique Sanders. (Check them out!)</p><br /><br /><p>Personally, I feel this is my best music to date. Best mixing, best production, and I'm just more confident in my skills as a rapper. You'll hear some spoken word, quality rapping, live instrumentation, some great grooves to get that head bobbin' (ranging from gospel, funk, future soul, hip hop and R&B) and I even got a trap song on there. It's super positive trap... but I think it's legit. Excited for the people to hear it. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/r8VeNhb0aGA?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What has been your greatest creative challenge with the new music? How did you work through that challenge?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My greatest challenge has been finding the right people to work with and having money to pay for it. I'm very particular and I’m a full time musician. So I don't make a ton of money or gig that often and quality music isn't free (especially when you have high standards like I do). So, I needed the highest quality product for the right deal. I had a deal with The Xtraordinairs to record an EP that they would produce but that was postponed, mainly because they were busy working with higher paying clients (which is cool lol you gotta make that money). This was a small setback, but I decided not give up on what I wanted. So I was willing to wait for the opportunity to work with Dom Sanders and Anthony Saunders. I ended up waiting about a year (give or take a few months) while doing shows, working to improve my artistry before I was able to get these magical sessions with Dom and Anthony separately. Dom ended up producing 3 of the 6 songs on the EP. Anthony produced one and sang as well. All at a very affordable rate. : ) Patience is truly a virtue. I always say that I don't hear ""no"" just ""not yet"" eventually you going to agree with me.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/rPb05Hi2CVc?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>The videos you’ve made for your songs really bring out the sense of joy inherent in your work. How did you learn to direct and produce these videos?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>First, Thank you. You never know who is really watching. I'm at the point where people give very little feedback to me as the artist. It's nice to know the energy is coming through. To answer you, I'm a visionary, I love learning, and I believe I can be pretty good at everything I do. Especially with a little practice. I despise waiting for people get things done, I'm about that action! (I got that from my dad. He learned to professionally cook BBQ by watching BBQ pit masters. He ended up getting 1st place in ribs in his his first competition, out of like 200 entries. Crazy. ) I watch videos, tutorials, and ask questions every time I'm with a videographer or photographer. Then I just apply the techniques in the simplest form possible to deliver the highest quality result. I still have work to do, but it's a solid start. My creativity is still limited by my resources but I make the most out of what I have. I could have nothing. If you have time to complain, you have time to find a solution to your problem. </p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p><strong>What inspires you about hip-hop and futuristic soul in KC?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I'm still new to the hip hop scene. I'm more on the band side which was intentional given my musical background. However for hip-hop, I'm really into Gee Watts, Sauce, Khrystal, and Kartez Marcel. For Soul, It's Mae C. She is an amazing talent. For me, I caught this new wind when I discovered Eddie Moore and the Outercircle (Deandre manning, Zach Morrow, Adam Schlozman). These guys have changed my life. They’re amazing people. Word to Sam Sartorius and JeffreyStoX. They really support me and stick by me and inspire me to keep going by their level of commitment and musicianship. These guys have been crucial to my success and I hope they stay around for the long haul. Lastly, Dom Sanders. Since I met him he's been my #1 inspiration and my favorite musician and producer in KC. I'm tryna be like him when I grow up! lol</p><br /><br /></div><div ><div ><div ><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />     <img typeof=""foaf:Image"" src=""/sites/default/files/images/11025731_902694166448279_4359020322569125548_n.jpg"" width=""960"" height=""621"" alt=""Duncan Burnett"" title=""Duncan Burnett"" />        </div><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-caption-caption--field-image-with-caption.tpl.php -->    Duncan Burnett  -- Photo By Colin Clark         </div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div>    <p><strong>Duncan's recommendations from the Johnson County Library catalog:</strong></p><br /><br /><p><em><strong><a href=""https://jocolibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/293981036"">Harry Potter & The Sorcerer's Stone</a></strong></em> by J.K.

Besides music, what other projects are you involved with?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Hello!  I'm a musician and yogi in Kansas City.  I make a living playing music, teaching music, and teaching yoga.  I grew up in Massachusetts, went to grad school in California, and have lived in KC for about five years.  I play regularly with my Irish band, Into the Sun.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />   <br /><br /><div class=""embedded-video""><br /><br />  <div class=""player""><br /><br />    <iframe class="""" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/DEwPLoeXSCA?width%3D640%26amp%3Bheight%3D360%26amp%3Bautoplay%3D0%26amp%3Bvq%3Dlarge%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bcontrols%3D1%26amp%3Bautohide%3D2%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D1%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D0%26amp%3Btheme%3Ddark%26amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D1%26amp%3Bwmode%3Dopaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </div><br /><br /></div><br /><br />        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>Your first album, <em>A Beautiful Dying, </em> was inspired by the passing of your mother to cancer in 2014. Can you delve into how writing and creating this music was part of your healing process?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>My mother was an incredibly beautiful soul and stood strong in support of my career path as a musician.  She was at every concert and every recital.  Mom was sick with cancer for four years.  The sicker she got, the less I wanted to play music.  It was too painful, too interwoven with her love.  When Mom passed, it became clear that music was the only way I could truly honor her.  Creating 'A Beautiful Dying' was a lot of ""firsts"" for me: the first time I wrote songs, lead a band, organized a concert, went through the recording process, and received a grant.  It was a lot of work and a lot of learning and it helped me move through my grief.  Grief is brutal and exhausting but it reveals truth if you let it.  I needed to step into creating my own music and share my experiences with death and dying.  By connecting with other people who are on their own healing path, my heart has healed little by little.</p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333772934&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What were some of the unexpected challenges you encountered while making <em> A Beautiful Dying</em>?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Ha...well, when I realized I wanted to create this project I knew I needed  to be by myself for a chunk of time to focus on my work.  I was offered a two month stay at a phenomenal farmhouse built in 1860 on the coast of Maine.  My family still lives in New England and I decided to sell my things, pack my car, and move back east.  I spent two months in Maine,  writing, journaling, practicing music and yoga, and hiking Acadia National Park.  It was incredible.  My mom and I had spent lots of time together in Maine and being by the ocean connected me to her Spirit.  When the two months were up, I had a rough idea of what the album would be.  Then I realized that the musicians I wanted to work with all lived in...Kansas City!  So I packed my car and drove west.  It was a lot of driving and a lot of moving but things fell into place relatively easily.  My cat may tell you a different story.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333772412&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What may surprise a listener about how you write your music?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>A lot of my material comes from my dreams.  I need dreams to process what is happening in the waking world and I always keep a dream journal next to my bed.  I have a lucid dreaming practice and have received specific pieces of information over the years.  There is a lyric in my song, 'No End', ""Let go into the blue"" which came directly from a lucid dream I had in which I asked to know how Mom doing was after she passed.  I was shown a beautiful translucent female figure surrounded in blue.  She was happy as she dissolved into the sea.  Different people have different ways of *seeing* and mine is through dreaming. </p><br /><br /></div><div ><br /><br /><!-- field.tpl --><div ><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <!-- tpl file: * field--field-local-music-media-share--field-local-music-content.tpl.php -->    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""450"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333775574&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true""></iframe>        </div><br /><br /><br /><br />    <p><strong>What inspires you about original music in Kansas City?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>I ended up moving to KC on a complete whim.  I had been driving back and forth across the country trying to decide on a place to live after grad school.  I visited a friend in Kansas City and liked it immediately.  I didn't have anywhere else to be so I got an apartment a week later.  Kansas City is chock full of music and I remember being thrilled to have so many choices of shows to attend for reasonable prices.  I play traditional Irish music and the folk scene in KC is alive and well.  It's a great city for music.  </p><br /><br /></div><div >    <p>Recommendations! I had a bit of trouble here.  I searched about 20 books and artists I've been reading and listening to but most weren't in the catalog!  Here's what I found:</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Music</p><br /><br /><p>Side Pony -Lake Street Dive</p><br /><br /><p>One of my favorite bands!  I've followed Lake Street Dive for years and love their latest CD, especially 'Mistakes.'  </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Astral Weeks -Van Morrison</p><br /><br /><p>This album is incredible in it's mix of freedom and togetherness.  There are moments that sound like the band is coming apart, stretching time in different ways, then in an instant they are together again. It's pure beauty.  'Sweet Thing' is one of my favorite songs of all time.  </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Books</p><br /><br /><p>When Things Fall Apart -Pema Chodron</p><br /><br /><p>This is truly heart advice for difficult times.  After my mom died and several other relationships fell apart, a friend handed me this book.  Pema has a way of speaking truth that is gentle and calming.  I always keep a copy of her book around to read when life gets turbulent. </p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Consider the Lobster -David Foster Wallce</p><br /><br /><p>I love everything I've read by David Foster Wallace but I have a special affinity for his short story about the Lobster Festival held annually in  Rockland, ME.  My grandmother had a cottage near Rockland and I spent many summer days walking around the main drag.  Rockland was also where I decided to stop eating meat at age ten because of lobsters.  I'm still vegetarian and I still love lobsters :)</p><br /><br /></div>","0","437","0","","1503508973","0","0","New Age|World - Beats","","Listen Local","Adult","/we-recommend/listen-local/molly-mclaughlin","",""
